# `rssgen`

## Description

Some websites don't prioritize RSS feeds, either by not having them at all or by burying them deep. This repository aims to make it easier to access such data sources by:
- Generating RSS/Atom feeds for data sources that lack them.
- Generating direct links to existing feeds for data sources that have them.
