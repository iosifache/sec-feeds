# `sec-feeds`

Some cybersecurity data sources I'm interested in don't have RSS feeds. This repository generates and serves Atom feeds for them.

## Data Sources

| ID       | Name            | Data                                   |
| -------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `phrack` | Phrack Magazine | All articles from all published issues |

## Usage

Just import `iosifache.me/feeds/<id>` into your RSS reader, where `<id>` is the ID of the data source you are interested in.
