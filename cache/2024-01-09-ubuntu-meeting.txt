[15:32] <cpaelzer> non proposed is very small now
[15:32] <sarnold> \o/
[15:32] <cpaelzer> lxml is worked on by foundations I guess
[15:32] <cpaelzer> yes slyon I see
[15:32] <cpaelzer> good
[15:33] <cpaelzer> the other is the known false positive
[15:33] <cpaelzer> proposed has mostly known things
[15:33] <cpaelzer> nut
[15:33] <cpaelzer> dkim-perl
[15:33] <cpaelzer> jaraco
[15:33] <cpaelzer> I'm not sure I remember libqmi
[15:33] <cpaelzer> and alembic I've seen long ago, seems to be needing something again
[15:34] <cpaelzer> alembic was openstack IIRC - right jamespage?
[15:34] <jbicha> o/
[15:34] <jamespage> it is
[15:34] <cpaelzer> hi jbicha

[15:34] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2002821 in python-typing-extensions (Ubuntu) "[MIR] python-typing-extensions" [Undecided, In Progress]
[15:34] <cpaelzer> was filed
[15:34] <cpaelzer> was reviewed
[15:34] <cpaelzer> open to clear ...
[15:34] <eslerm> hi o/
[15:35] <jbicha> libqmi is libqrtr-glib from last week
[15:35] <jamespage> subscriptions all in place to support that
[15:35] <cpaelzer> oh it seems only the subscription was missing
[15:35] <cpaelzer> and it was approved before
[15:36] <jamespage> yep - dependency looks to be coming in via jaraco and alembic now
[15:36] <cpaelzer> yes the tree of deps changed
[15:36] <cpaelzer> but it is ready
[15:36] <cpaelzer> jamespage: will you promote it now that it is ready?
[15:36] <cpaelzer> or do you want one of us to do so?
[15:37] <cpaelzer> oh you can't
[15:37] <jamespage> nope I can't ;)
[15:37] <jamespage> needs an aa
[15:37] <cpaelzer> sorry, my memory gave you more permissions
[15:37] <cpaelzer> I'll do so tomorrow morning once I have time to do last saftey checks
[15:37] <jamespage> I don't have the required superpoers
[15:37] <cpaelzer> but it LGTM
[15:38] <cpaelzer> next (as I learned of last week) https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libqrtr-glib/+bug/1963707
[15:38] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 1963707 in libqrtr-glib (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libqrtr-glib" [Low, In Progress]
[15:38] <cpaelzer> That was ok, seb completed the dependency for it to show up
[15:38] <cpaelzer> I can promote that too then
[15:39] <slyon> +1
[15:39] <cpaelzer> lsat but not least
[15:39] <cpaelzer> on modbus we are waiting on Debian
[15:39] <cpaelzer> not infinitely, but we want to give them time and if possible move together
[15:39] <cpaelzer> FYI https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1059985
[15:39] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Debian bug 1059985 in nut "apc_modbus pulls in libmodbus in the default installation" [Normal, Open]

[15:40] <cpaelzer> oh wow
[15:40] <cpaelzer> three new
[15:40] <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gsasl/+bug/2044535 actually is only shown as it is up in the task list
[15:40] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2044535 in libgssglue (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libgssglue" [Undecided, New]
[15:40] <cpaelzer> the request is for libgssglue Edit
[15:40] <slyon> this seems to be a false positive
[15:40] <slyon> It's assigned to security
[15:41] <cpaelzer> we need to mark this something else than New
[15:41] <cpaelzer> doing so
[15:41] <slyon> Is it due to the unassigned gsasl task?
[15:41] <cpaelzer> yes
[15:41] <slyon> Could probably be Invalid.
[15:41] <slyon> It was just to make it show up on foundations reports
[15:41] <slyon> I can handle that
[15:41] <cpaelzer> ok
[15:42] <cpaelzer> I've already updated
[15:42] <cpaelzer> feel free to change it further
[15:42] <cpaelzer> next two are christmas presents from seb128

[15:42] <cpaelzer> both related to pipewire
[15:42] <cpaelzer> to support more things
[15:42] <cpaelzer> speex is a codec
[15:42] <cpaelzer> what is roc ...
[15:43] <cpaelzer> streaming
[15:43] <cpaelzer> ok, either way
[15:43] <cpaelzer> this needs reviewers
[15:43] <cpaelzer> anyone up to take one this week?
[15:44] <slyon> I can take one for next tuesday
[15:44] <cpaelzer> thx, handing you roc
[15:44] <cpaelzer> jamespage: didrocks: joalif: anyone ok to review speexdsp ?
[15:45] <cpaelzer> until the mid cycle spint I'm not sure I can handle one easily
[15:46] <eslerm> (I just set pydantic to incomplete for jamepage 's review)
[15:46] <cpaelzer> didrocks: mentioned he has a conflict usually now but is ok to pick one if highlighted, I'll do so and if impossible let me know and I'll try to squeeze it in ignoring the planning
[15:46] <cpaelzer> thanks eslerm
[15:46] <cpaelzer> ok, next agenda item
[15:46] <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions

[15:46] <cpaelzer> pydantic eslerm mentioned
[15:46] <cpaelzer> python-cssselect we mentioned before as well
[15:47] <cpaelzer> and the dmarc related things are from mirespace
[15:47] <cpaelzer> there was one update in one of those ...
[15:47] <cpaelzer> reading
[15:47] <sarnold> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/objgraph/+bug/2047821 ?
[15:47] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2047821 in objgraph (Ubuntu) "[MIR] objgraph" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:47] <cpaelzer> ok still on her
[15:47] <cpaelzer> sarnold: that one is good
[15:47] <eslerm> pydantic has security ack already, but upstream brought up a concern afterwards
[15:47] <cpaelzer> that was there for a potential MIr
[15:47] <cpaelzer> but fixed in cherrypy3 last few days
[15:48] <cpaelzer> eslerm: oh is that what happened, reading ...
[15:48] <cpaelzer> jamespage: I think the pydantic question is for you to answer that is from the openstack deps
[15:49] <cpaelzer> will this change to v2 to not be stuck?
[15:49] <eslerm> I'm not sure what stuck means, debian hasn't updated to v2 yet
[15:49] <sarnold> the pydantic in debian seems unhappy https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1058324 and the v2 uses rust https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1052619 -- there may not be an easy path forward
[15:49] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Debian bug 1058324 in src:pydantic "pydantic: FTBFS: failed tests" [Serious, Open]
[15:49] <cpaelzer> https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/tags
[15:49] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Debian bug 1052619 in wnpp "ITP: pydantic-core -- Rust implementation of pydantic core functionality" [Wishlist, Open]
[15:50] <cpaelzer> there are really many 2.x updates but only minimal fix updates on 1.x
[15:50] <cpaelzer> eslerm: and they have no namespacing calling it pydantic2 to be co-installable or any such?
[15:51] <eslerm> I'm not aware of that
[15:51] <cpaelzer> hrm
[15:51] <cpaelzer> ok, incomplete is right for james and the team to answer how they want to deal with that
[15:51] <cpaelzer> it can be 1.x now, but we'd need a commitment to make it 2.x to maintain it in the long run - is that the correct state eslerm?
[15:51] <eslerm> that feels appropriate to me
[15:51] <cpaelzer> eslerm: would you require 2.x in noble or any time later?
[15:52] <eslerm> likely, Seth?
[15:52] <eslerm> security support in LTS would be much better with 2.x
[15:52] <jamespage> I don't think that's under debate and I did comment on this - it just quite a wide set of packages to test and update to bump to 2 right now
[15:52] <sarnold> I'm not sure "require" is quite the right word; the timing is pretty poor :(
[15:52] <cpaelzer> indeed
[15:52] <eslerm> +1
[15:52] <cpaelzer> reading more of the backlog
[15:53] <cpaelzer> we even discussed that
[15:53] <sarnold> a change of this magnitude would be nice to do *before* an LTS release; I could easily imagine the upstream folks moving on to a hypothetical 2.1 and 2.2 etc in quick order, as they keep making progress...
[15:53] <jamespage> we did
[15:53] <cpaelzer> and I should remember as I posted in november
[15:53] <cpaelzer> "- not going to 2.x for now, thanks for explaining"
[15:53] <sarnold> hah, nice
[15:53] <cpaelzer> ok, so this can go back to in-progress
[15:53] <cpaelzer> was worth to make sure
[15:53] <eslerm> upstreams comment was: "Just to confirm, I assume it will be pydantic V2 that's added to Ubuntu main?! It would be very unfortunate if an old and outdated version was added."
[15:54] <sarnold> old, outdated, and hopefuilly stable :)
[15:54] <cpaelzer> we will add v1 to main now and update it in the future to v2
[15:54] <eslerm> sounds good to me
[15:54] <cpaelzer> oh wow
[15:54] <cpaelzer> the time
[15:54] <cpaelzer> arr

[15:55] <slyon> wow, so clean!
[15:55] <slyon> oh well, I have a filter on :D
[15:55] <sarnold> they have not; we've had this conversation with upstream as part of working the pydantic mir
[15:55] <sarnold> ha ;)
[15:56] <sarnold> but it's not yet recovered full velocity
