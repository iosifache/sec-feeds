[02:50]  * tsimonq2 throws on a $dayjob hat
[02:50] <tsimonq2> So, something regressed in PHP 8.1 in Jammy, as the result of a security update.
[02:50] <tsimonq2> I'll give it a day or so before I go file a regression-update bug.
[02:50] <tsimonq2> That being said, is_file() is completely broken, and I have anecdotal evidence confirming.
[02:50] <tsimonq2> Is *anyone* else experiencing issues with PHP 8.1?
[08:04] <ebarretto> leosilva, fyi ^ 
[12:28]  * leosilva looks
[12:30] <leosilva> tsimonq2: do you mind point ways to reproduce it, pls?
[16:01] <tsimonq2> leosilva: I will prepare a POC for you by EOD. :)
[16:21] <leosilva> tsimonq2: thanks! =]
