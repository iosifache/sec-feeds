[15:31] <jamespage> going to have to send my apologies - sorry
[15:31] <cpaelzer> ok
[15:31] <cpaelzer> we'll give you some todo then jamespage :-P
[15:32] <cpaelzer> more content than last time
[15:32] <cpaelzer> nullboot now shows up there
[15:32] <cpaelzer> it has a case
[15:32] <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nullboot/+bug/1965115
[15:32] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 1965115 in nullboot (Ubuntu) "[MIR] nullboot" [Undecided, In Progress]
[15:32] <cpaelzer> that is almost a year old
[15:33] <cpaelzer> But other than a bit more info on testing
[15:33] <cpaelzer> which now that it is meant to be used might be easier
[15:33] <cpaelzer> this ought to be ready
[15:33] <joalif> o/
[15:33] <eslerm> \o/
[15:34] <cpaelzer> slyon: I think you might want to ping internally that this might be soon promoted?
[15:34] <slyon> yes, I'll double-check this
[15:34] <sarnold> good morning
[15:35] <eslerm> hi Seth o/
[15:35] <cpaelzer> I updated the bug slyon
[15:35] <cpaelzer> this looks easy to be fully completed
[15:35] <cpaelzer> in proposed we have more
[15:35] <cpaelzer> but mostly old usual suspects
[15:36] <cpaelzer> mirespace: will you let us know when libcryptx-perl is ready for now (without the algorithm that is badly implemented)?
[15:36] <cpaelzer> if anyone here is curious, we found a compromise how to go on with https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libcryptx-perl/+bug/2046154
[15:36] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2046154 in libcryptx-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libcryptx-perl (libmail-dkim-perl dependency)" [Undecided, New]
[15:36] <cpaelzer> TL;DR get is completed (the whole stack) with all, except ed25519
[15:36] <mirespace> yes, I will do ... not touched since the steps sgreement, sorry
[15:37] <cpaelzer> go for a ed25519 implementation as wrapper around the supported openssl
[15:37] <mirespace> yes
[15:37] <cpaelzer> and then add that to Ubuntu
[15:37] <cpaelzer> next new in mismatches is "designate"
[15:37] <cpaelzer> wantin python-edgegrid and ndg-httpsclient
[15:37] <cpaelzer> never heard of this
[15:37] <cpaelzer> I'm sure this will haunt me and it is a server package ...
[15:38] <cpaelzer> oh no, it is openstack
[15:38] <eslerm> (I'm behind in comments in the bug for libcryptx-perl, apologize, discussion looks good)
[15:38] <cpaelzer> thanks eslerm
[15:38] <cpaelzer> jamespage: I assume you need to pick this up later designate -> python-edgegrid and ndg-httpsclient will need to be looked at
[15:39] <cpaelzer> to make a decision to promote or change dependencies
[15:39] <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

[15:39] <cpaelzer> wow
[15:39] <cpaelzer> there are 5 new in there
[15:39] <cpaelzer> cryptx goes back to mirespace until this change has happend
[15:39] <cpaelzer> I'll update the bug
[15:40] <cpaelzer> The rest are things we knew are coming
[15:40] <slyon> so I could probably take wsl-pro-service, as the others are from foundations
[15:40] <cpaelzer> yeah
[15:40] <joalif> I could take trace-cmd
[15:41] <cpaelzer> thanks assigned
[15:41] <joalif> but no promises it'll be ready by next week, I'm already working on another 2 mirs
[15:41] <cpaelzer> yeah
[15:41] <cpaelzer> fair
[15:41] <cpaelzer> I'll take libtracefs
[15:41] <cpaelzer> and as usual didrocks is fine to get one scheduled (at least that was the deal so far)
[15:42] <cpaelzer> which I'll do with libtraceevent
[15:42] <cpaelzer> TBH I'm also not yet entirely sure when I'll get to mine
[15:42] <cpaelzer> surely not before Friday and even then ...
[15:42] <cpaelzer> but we now have one each
[15:42] <cpaelzer> and the list is drained
[15:43] <cpaelzer> \o/
[15:43] <cpaelzer> BTW trace-cmd and related are part of the many MIRs to be expected that I mentioned last week
[15:43] <cpaelzer> around debug/perf tooling to be available more easily
[15:43] <slyon> yes, there are more in the works at foundations

[15:44] <cpaelzer> only one somewhat recent
[15:44] <cpaelzer> jpeg-xl
[15:44] <cpaelzer> that is yet incomplete and marked that way by jbicha
[15:44] <cpaelzer> so no need to act on that for now

[15:45] <cpaelzer> there is a new one https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/47

[15:45] <eslerm> thank you

[15:46] <eslerm> for apparmor profiles, we oculd put this off until after 24.04
[15:46] <cpaelzer> this has been discussed in the past
[15:46] <eslerm> an apparmor profile will be required for authd
[15:47] <cpaelzer> it was a "would be nice, but sometimes is impossibly hard" case
[15:47] <cpaelzer> just like some others we had
[15:47] <cpaelzer> I'm +1 on having such a rule
[15:47] <cpaelzer> after all we keep having "add profiles" items every cycle
[15:47] <cpaelzer> to get things added in the past isolated
[15:47] <cpaelzer> but
[15:47] <cpaelzer> I'd ask for some "not too easy, but there is a way out" kind of wording
[15:47] <cpaelzer> if you happen to be providing the 1245676th package of the gnome stack
[15:48] <eslerm> recently, the apparmor team has begun needing to write profiles (there is a new mandate) and it would be nice if owning or development teams owned that
[15:48] <cpaelzer> then you can't be expected to be the one that makes all gnome isolated
[15:48] <cpaelzer> for example
[15:48] <cpaelzer> I've seen the updates on jira about adding apparmor
[15:48] <eslerm> that type of wording works
[15:48] <cpaelzer> and I smiled as - like I said - we do that almost every cycle for a while
[15:48] <cpaelzer> but we had cases where you just can not predict the millions of ways something is used
[15:49] <sarnold> so very true
[15:49] <eslerm> I believe apparmor folks would be responsible to review, it would be reasonable
[15:49] <cpaelzer> with a wording that is not too allowing but leaving a door open I'm ok
[15:49] <cpaelzer> will you or the apparmor folks provide a PR on how they think
[15:49] <eslerm> can do
[15:49] <cpaelzer> we can then discuss until we reach a wording we believe that works
[15:49] <cpaelzer> and the first few passing that will then tell us how possible or impossible that is
[15:49] <eslerm> I wanted to start the discussion, and work on this mostly for 24.10
[15:50] <cpaelzer> so epxect reviewing this in a while
[15:50] <eslerm> thank you
[15:50] <cpaelzer> ack on please not being applicable to 24.04 super late
[15:50] <cpaelzer> thanks for the heads up
[15:50] <cpaelzer> section wise we are in security
[15:50] <cpaelzer> I see the training of people worked
[15:50] <cpaelzer> plenty of new faces assigned in the in-progress column
[15:50] <cpaelzer> a few TODO, but nothing in the far backlog
[15:51] <cpaelzer> umm
[15:51] <cpaelzer> eslerm: about SEC-2671
[15:51] <cpaelzer> the LP item went to Won't Fix
[15:51] <cpaelzer> and sarnold ^^
[15:52] <cpaelzer> the dependency tree has been changed, this won't be needed
[15:52] <cpaelzer> should it be removed from the security board as well?
[15:52] <sarnold> nice :)
[15:52] <eslerm> thanks for catching that, I'll move them
[15:53] <cpaelzer> thanks
[15:53] <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?
[15:53] <cpaelzer> nothing in addition to the above from me
[15:53] <slyon> nothing
[15:53] <sarnold> nothing
[15:55] <cpaelzer> ok
[15:55] <cpaelzer> then, enjoy your week!
[15:55] <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, all :)
