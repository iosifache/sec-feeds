[22:24] <Juest> hey
[22:24] <Juest> what's happening with keyserver.ubuntu.com?
[22:24] <Juest> somehow my secring.gpg is getting nulled when i run --refresh-keys
[23:50] <sarnold> Juest: that's very weird indeed https://paste.debian.net/1306823/
[23:51] <Juest> sarnold: oops, i meant to say that the keyring corrupts when i refresh keys
[23:51] <Juest> on a different distro
[23:51] <sarnold> Juest: heh, i figured that you might have meant pubring instead..
[23:51] <Juest> using latest gpg
[23:51] <Juest> yeah probably
[23:52] <Juest> still, very weird that it still happens after recreating it multiple times
[23:52] <Juest> and even rebooted
