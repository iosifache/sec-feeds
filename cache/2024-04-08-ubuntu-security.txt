[01:36] <blahdeblah> amurray: +1 to that - I think there'll be ongoing fun from this one.
[01:36] <blahdeblah> Although I would probably nitpick your characterisation of it as the biggest Open Source issue since Meltdown/Spectre.  What about log4shell?  Much more widely exploited...
[02:08] <amurray> blahdeblah: oh indeed, log4shell was more exploited, but I don't think I have seen an issue get so much n news coverage so quickly as this 
[02:08] <blahdeblah> In terms of hype it's definitely up there. :-)
