[09:44] <mpiano> hi folks, we noticed that the OVAL CVE bundles are not getting updated (the last update happened on 2024-05-29T00:22:54), could someone please look into that?
[09:44] <mpiano> (the USN bundles are still getting updates)
[09:45] <mpiano> by "CVE bundle" I mean this for example: https://security-metadata.canonical.com/oval/com.ubuntu.jammy.cve.oval.xml.bz2
[09:53] <ebarretto> mpiano: we are currently investigating it, thanks for the heads up :)
[09:53] <mpiano> ebarretto: perfect, thank you ð
[11:12] <ebarretto> mpiano: it just finished generating data, let us know if you see any other issues
