[15:31] <cpaelzer> wow
[15:31] <cpaelzer> the new nvidia driver is wanted a lot
[15:31] <cpaelzer> I'm not in the mood to count the lines
[15:31] <cpaelzer> but those are normal, no new MIR needed and the team handles them well
[15:31] <cpaelzer> no action needed
[15:31] <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-cssselect/+bug/2048760 is open
[15:31] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2048760 in python-cssselect (Ubuntu) "[MIR] python-cssselect" [Undecided, Confirmed]
[15:32] <cpaelzer> I guess we will see that later as it seems ready for review
[15:32] <slyon> yes
[15:32] <joalif> o/
[15:32] <eslerm> (just curious, how would I run mismatch on an arbitrary universe package to see its MIR requirements)
[15:32] <cpaelzer> dkim-perl is known and still worked on by mirespace
[15:32] <sarnold> good morning
[15:33] <cpaelzer> eslerm: https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir?tab=readme-ov-file#tools
[15:33] <eslerm> thanks!
[15:33] <cpaelzer> IIRC I wrote my own as it wasn't doing recursive needs
[15:33] <cpaelzer> not sure anymore, it was long long ago
[15:33] <cpaelzer> it is the right start
[15:33] <cpaelzer> the rest in mismatches is also known
[15:33] <cpaelzer> python-infelct
[15:34] <cpaelzer> the same cssselect
[15:34] <cpaelzer> and known logcheck->esmtp
[15:34] <cpaelzer> going on in the agenda ...

[15:34] <cpaelzer> let me read the discussion ont he latter
[15:35] <slyon> I assume the latter could be WONTFIX, as mirespace changed the reverse-dependency, so that it is no longer needed
[15:35] <cpaelzer> yeah that is how I read the comments too
[15:36] <cpaelzer> The former looks for a reviewer

[15:37] <cpaelzer> we have slyon and me and it is slyon's case ... avoiding self-review I think I have to take this one
[15:37] <cpaelzer> While I have more sprint things to prep that should squeeze in well (hope dies last)
[15:38] <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions
[15:38] <slyon> The MIR templated used here ^ is a bit outdated. mkukri is willing to update it if needed. But overall the package seems to be in good shape, so we should be fine reviewing as-is, IMO

[15:38] <slyon> cpaelzer: joalif was also waving above
[15:38] <cpaelzer> oh, blind me
[15:38] <cpaelzer> indeed
[15:38] <joalif> I was about to write the same :p
[15:38]  * cpaelzer opens eyes
[15:38] <joalif> I can take one
[15:38] <cpaelzer> I've seen the security folks and slyon - sorry joalif
[15:38] <joalif> no worries
[15:38] <slyon> squeezing it in between a sprint, might not be the best idea
[15:38] <joalif> i was abit late to the party
[15:39] <cpaelzer> passed cssselect to you then joalif
[15:39] <joalif> ok
[15:39] <slyon> thx joalif!
[15:39] <cpaelzer> I'll need to thank you in my sprint presentation somehow now ...

[15:39] <cpaelzer> comments on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dbus-broker/+bug/2015538
[15:39] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2015538 in dbus-broker (Ubuntu) "[MIR] dbus-broker" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:40] <mkukri> i unfortunately didnt have time to impove python3-cssselect today, but will have it done by next week
[15:40] <cpaelzer> That is a Debian maintainer and upstream systemd contributor offering to help
[15:40] <eslerm> I asked SEG and there wasn't extra capacity to take dbus-brokers wrapper
[15:40] <cpaelzer> But it will still be O-release
[15:40] <slyon> mkukri: please coordinate with joalif about that (maybe it's not needed)
[15:40] <cpaelzer> eslerm: interesting, what was the answer?
[15:41] <cpaelzer> it is kind of a very soon or in 24.10 atm right?
[15:41] <eslerm> it was a favor request, they mentioned that they were tight on people but someone *might* be interested to take it on
[15:41] <eslerm> adding the wrapper likely needs to go on a roadmap
[15:41] <sarnold> yeah, and it's a large enough change that even if it were done today, I think there'd be serious questions about switching to it now
[15:42] <cpaelzer> by not finding time we are also becoming one of the few that have not yet switched :-/
[15:42] <cpaelzer> fedora changed ages ago, arch did announce the same last week
[15:42] <sarnold> err .. the first "large change" is switching dbus implementations; the second "it were done today" was the (presumably) smallish wrapper
[15:42] <eslerm> Security eyeballed how much work the wrapper would take during the review. There's a little bit of process state handling, but not much
[15:42] <cpaelzer> maybe the link is worth adding to second the rationale?
[15:43] <eslerm> I can
[15:43] <cpaelzer> I'll add it
[15:44] <slyon> dbus-broker was mostly driven by desktop. I wonder if seb128 is interested in merging v35 (even though it's in universe)? Just to keep it up to date
[15:44] <cpaelzer> I still doubt this can happen without Desktop finding and dedicating resources to it
[15:45] <slyon> adding the wrapper is another story then
[15:45] <cpaelzer> ack
[15:45] <cpaelzer> in the context of the MIR meeting this is interesting but not blocking us
[15:45] <cpaelzer> would one ping Seb and others to ensure they reconsider it again as it is kind of the last chance to do so?
[15:46] <slyon> I can
[15:46] <cpaelzer> thx
[15:46] <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

[15:46] <cpaelzer> any major change already on that front?
[15:47] <eslerm> some in Foundations MM
[15:47] <eslerm> not a major roadmap item atm, but there is related work to do
[15:47] <slyon> verdict was that the Foundations toolchain squad does not have capacity to work on it this cycle, but security might start working on some relevant tooling
[15:47] <cpaelzer> ok
[15:47] <cpaelzer> thanks for the update

[15:48] <cpaelzer> There seem to be 6 in TODO+Backlog
[15:48] <cpaelzer> given that we are closing in towards FF and with a bit more distance towards release
[15:48] <cpaelzer> could security do a spike to get those handled?
[15:49] <eslerm> I'm training the certs/fips folks for MIRs after this meeting (libgssglue) and setting up similar meeting for fdk-aac-free
[15:49] <cpaelzer> well, that is great to hear
[15:49] <eslerm> the perl ones are more or less done, it would be nice if another perl one was ready
[15:49] <eslerm> libmysofa is still in upstream's hands iiuc
[15:49] <cpaelzer> libmail-mime-perl is in TODO
[15:49] <eslerm> openscap is a backlog security task (not for MIR)
[15:49] <eslerm> I'm not aware of roc-toolkit yet
[15:49]  * eslerm looks
[15:50] <cpaelzer> arr, that was one that was switched away
[15:50] <cpaelzer> you might want to remove the card in your jira though
[15:50] <slyon> eslerm: I finished roc-toolkit MIR review today. It's ready for security review
[15:50] <eslerm> \o/
[15:50] <eslerm> I'll try to assign it this week
[15:50] <cpaelzer> I'll ping mirespace if there are any more perl MIRs waiting to get them to us asap for you to be able to use them for training
[15:51] <eslerm> thank you
[15:51] <eslerm> Andrei has worked up a perl fuzzing process for those
[15:52] <cpaelzer> ok, I pinged mirespace about it
[15:52] <eslerm> perl turns out not to be great for training though :)
[15:52] <mirespace> cpaelzer: They all are submitted
[15:52] <cpaelzer> ah
[15:52] <cpaelzer> well, great
[15:52] <cpaelzer> afte rso many months of yet another no one thought of that to be possible :-)
[15:52] <mirespace> hehe... well, let's see how libcryptX evolves :(
[15:52] <sarnold> mirespace: woo :) nice work working those through :)
[15:53] <cpaelzer> mirespace: libcryptx was the bad one enmbedding another version of a lib right?
[15:53] <mirespace> thanks sarnold! :$
[15:53] <mirespace> yes, that one
[15:53] <cpaelzer> *sigh*
[15:53] <cpaelzer> why can't things ever be easy
[15:54] <cpaelzer> mirespace: hmm, reading the comment
[15:54] <cpaelzer> it seems you wait for us on this
[15:54] <cpaelzer> but by being assigned to you it won't show up in any query
[15:54] <cpaelzer> let me lÃ¶ink it here
[15:54] <cpaelzer> for us to have a look now
[15:54] <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libcryptx-perl/+bug/2046154
[15:54] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2046154 in libcryptx-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libcryptx-perl (libmail-dkim-perl dependency)" [Undecided, New]
[15:54] <cpaelzer> I'd appreciate we all could have a look to conclude on ways forward
[15:55] <cpaelzer> option #1 sounds even worse :-/
[15:56] <cpaelzer> for #2 - sad that even that ed25519 uses the embedded tomcrypt
[15:56] <eslerm> I'll bring this LP up during the fips/certs mir training
[15:56] <slyon> maybe adrien does have an opinion on that?
[15:57] <cpaelzer> I see how #3 is the easiest, but OTOH the one taking way the function users want from this whole stack of tools
[15:57] <eslerm> slyon: I'll ask
[15:57] <mirespace> I'm  working on trying to separate ed255519 from dkim itself at putting it like recommend... there is a sodium based perl lib that that handles also ed255519, but is pretty abandoned
[15:58] <cpaelzer> I think I miss #4 - make this an optional dependency, so that some encryptions work out of the bux and others are a suggest to a universe package
[15:58] <mirespace> (sorry, I put a extra that )
[15:58] <cpaelzer> really I'd love to see adriens and eslerm (after bringing it up) thoughts on this
[15:58] <sarnold> I'd love to know if they're abandoned because they are working fine and don't need maintaining, or if they're so busted that the authors gave up :(
[15:58] <cpaelzer> after all they might say "ok, while not great - using it as is is the least bad option"
[15:59] <cpaelzer> I mean I found that the embedded lib is more up to date than the lib itself
[15:59] <sarnold> ha
[15:59] <cpaelzer> time is running out
[15:59] <mirespace> (sorry, I need to drop ... thank you all)
[15:59] <sarnold> bye mirespace :) thanks
[15:59] <cpaelzer> looking forwadr to seeing your comment on the case later on
[15:59] <cpaelzer> we all need to drop ...

[20:07] <seb128> amurray, any opinion on what should be the next steps there?
[20:08] <amurray> yeah I am also a bit unsure - I wonder if we need a google meet session or similar to review the remaining comments as a group?
[20:09] <amurray> or we need to engage the store team to figure out if they can support the requirements

[20:22] <sil2100> Since I finished mine, maybe I could get assigned to it then
[20:22] <seb128> sil2100, what would be the action item?
[20:22] <seb128> the request seems reasonable so maybe we just need to vote?
[20:22] <sil2100> We can, but I didn't read it! Yet
[20:23] <seb128> sil2100, but thanks, let me add an action to review and call for a vote?
[20:23] <seb128> #action sil2100 to review the lubuntu LTS participation request and follow up as appropriate (question or call for vote)
[20:23] <meetingology> ACTION: sil2100 to review the lubuntu LTS participation request and follow up as appropriate (question or call for vote)
[20:23] <tsimonq2> I'm happy to answer any questions here or at a later point about Lubuntu's application. :)
[20:23] <seb128> sil2100, ^ sounds fine?
[20:24] <sil2100> Looks fine o/ Are you and amurray ready to vote as is?
[20:24] <amurray> yes
[20:24] <seb128> I want to read the emails again since I only glanced over them but it feels like it is ready
[20:25] <seb128> let's just do a call for vote on the list rather than trying to do it here today
[20:25] <seb128> did any of you had questions here today for tsimonq2 since he joined the meeting for us?
[20:25] <sil2100> I'm leaving it up to you. I'd like someone to do a proper review of it - if someone already did it, I'm fine with voting
[20:26] <seb128> no need to rush I would say
[20:26] <amurray> no, his email is very detailed and covers everything I would have wanted to know
[20:26] <seb128> you have an action item
[20:26] <seb128> we can call for vote on the list once you have reviewed it
[20:26] <seb128> no question from me either
[20:26] <sil2100> Ok o/
[20:27] <seb128> tsimonq2, no question it seems but thanks for taking the time to join the meeting in case we had some
[20:27] <seb128> #topic Check up on community bugs and techboard bugs
[20:27] <tsimonq2> Hey, one more thing on this topic, briefly...
[20:27] <seb128> tsimonq2, sure?
[20:28] <seb128> (no activity on the community bugs and techboard bugs)
[20:28] <tsimonq2> Actually, two, sorry. I noted lack of cooperation generally speaking on that email, and I've seen a drastic change for the better. I still have some (genuine) questions around the SRU Team given recent events, but I'm planning a postmorteum on virtualbox anyway.
[20:29] <tsimonq2> Also, I appointed Aaron and Dan as assistant release managers, there's no direct action required from the TB, but a "hey we see this" would be great. :)
[20:29] <rbasak> Well I asked and was told that no response was expected?
[20:30] <tsimonq2> Yes :) I'm glad you saw it, just making a general point to it.
[20:30] <tsimonq2> Anyway, those are the points I have, happy to answer any questions.
[20:30] <seb128> I'm not aware the SRU team situation you are referencing to but it doesn't seem to be a TB topic at this point?
[20:31] <seb128> aware of*
[20:31] <rbasak> I'm not sure either.
[20:32] <tsimonq2> My general point is, asking for requalification is a two-way agreement. We are happy to provide support for Lubuntu, the only reason I brought it up is to ensure we have support on the other side to be able to move the needle forward.
[20:32] <seb128> tsimonq2, and I've seen the email about the assistant release managers :-)
[20:32] <tsimonq2> seb128: thanks :)
[20:32] <seb128> ok, so seems there is no question/action there but thanks for mentioning those!
[20:32] <tsimonq2> Yes of course :)
[20:32] <seb128> #topic Select a chair for the next meeting (next from https://launchpad.net/~techboard/+members)
[20:33] <rbasak> I wonder if there's an opportunity to be talking more via the flavour syncs or something similar
[20:33] <vorlon> I promise I'll be here in time for the next one so you can keep me as chair ;)
[20:33] <seb128> next in the list is Steve and Lukasz as backup
[20:33] <rbasak> Because I'm seeing noises, but without specifics, I'm not in a position to be able to help at all.
[20:33] <seb128> vorlon, hey, and thanks!
[20:35] <seb128> rbasak, yes, the flavor syncs is a good venue for project discussions with flavor
[20:35] <seb128> flavors
[20:35] <tsimonq2> As far as I'm aware, the TB has an open invite to the Flavor Syncs. If you talk to the Community Team (specifically ilvipero_), he should be able to get you an invite.
[20:35] <seb128> #topic AOB
[20:35] <rbasak> Please do arrange for the SRU team and/or TB to be invited if there's a specific agenda item you have in mind that you'd like to discuss
[20:36] <tsimonq2> Absolutely, just finishing with my notes on this one. Thanks :)
[20:36] <seb128> I usually try to join at least the European tz compatible meeting and I think sil2100 has been to some of those as well
[20:37] <rbasak> I'm not aware of having been invited recently
[20:37] <tsimonq2> That sounds like a mistake to me :)
[20:37] <seb128> I think it's an open venue, ask Mauro to be added to the calendar invite if you wish to join
[20:38] <seb128> I usually join as a desktop representative, afaik we didn't have any formal request to have TB members there before
[20:38] <seb128> but I think we should at least review the invite list according to the topics on the agenda
[20:39] <seb128> that's not a meeting the TB own though, but I will still try to ensure we invite the right people
[20:39] <NotEickmeyer> Just pinged the appropriate people to get you all invites. :)
=== NotEickmeyer is now known as Eickmeyer
[20:39] <seb128> :)
[20:39] <Eickmeyer> My IRC client with issues. :)
[20:39] <rbasak> Thanks!
[20:39] <seb128> ok, I think that should be enough for that topic then
[20:40] <seb128> another other topic?
[20:40] <seb128> giving 3 min and if not then it's a wrap
[20:41] <tsimonq2> rbasak: I understand it's an action item, but an additional poke on the DMB inactivity stuff :)
[20:41] <amurray> nothing from me
[20:41] <tsimonq2> I did get frightened for a minute at Aaron's MOTU meeting.
[20:41]  * tsimonq2 is good
[20:42] <rbasak> tsimonq2: I've not been focused on that because it's usually worked out recently
[20:42] <rbasak> If people start getting near the threshold then I'll definitely prioritise that
[20:42] <tsimonq2> Okay :)
[20:43] <seb128> alright, seems we are done then
[20:43] <rbasak> Also it was very close to the New Year and I'd expect some disruption/unavailability around then.
[20:43] <tsimonq2> Very true.
[20:43] <seb128> thanks everyone!!
[20:43] <seb128> let's wrap?
[20:43] <rbasak> The plans won't change that since it's only sustained absence that would be actionable
[20:44] <tsimonq2> I'm okay wrapping, I believe we're on the same page.
[20:44] <seb128> ok, it's a wrap then, thanks everyone!
[20:44] <sil2100> Yeah, I need to apologize for missing out many DMB meetings lately
[20:45] <seb128> #endmeeting
[20:45] <meetingology> Meeting ended at 20:45:05 UTC.  Minutes at https://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting/2024/ubuntu-meeting.2024-01-16-20.04.moin.txt
[20:45] <sil2100> It's been so many Mondays that I just haven't been around
[20:45] <sil2100> o/
[20:45] <amurray> o/
[20:45] <seb128> sorry for being half around in that DMB meeting, I was sick on that day but still joined to be able to have quorum but I didn't manage to stick around all the time
[20:46] <Eickmeyer> seb128: You came in clutch, so you're more than forgiven from all sides, I'm sure. :D
[20:46] <seb128> :-)
[20:46] <tsimonq2> Agreed :)
[20:47] <Eickmeyer> seb128: And never apologize for being sick. I've had to say that to subordinates I've had in the past.
[20:48] <Eickmeyer> (not that you're subordinate to me, but the point still stands)
