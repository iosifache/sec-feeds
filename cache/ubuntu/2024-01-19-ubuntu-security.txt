[16:43] <georgiag> aiena: you can refer to the wiki in our gitlab https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/AppArmor_Core_Policy_Reference
[16:44] <georgiag> on the right there's a sidebar with more relevant pages
[16:50] <georgiag> aiena: I also think this one is very helpful https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-apparmor-profiles.html
