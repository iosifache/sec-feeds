[15:31] <sarnold> good morning
[15:31] <eslerm> good morning o/
[15:31] <sarnold> probably I should have asked last week if we were going to have this particular meeting :)
[15:33] <eslerm> only thing I have to report is that Security will pickup speexdsp after rok-toolkit is reviewed
[15:34] <eslerm> there is a lot of time in the cycle, and it will be best if the same reviewer can do both
[15:35] <eslerm> s/a lot of/enough
[15:39] <sarnold> heya slyon, since it's just eslerm and I we hadn't bothered starting the meeting
[15:39] <sarnold> slyon: depending on if you're actually around or if this is just your client auto-joining..
[15:39] <slyon> hey!
[15:39] <slyon> I was distracted, sorry.
[15:39] <slyon> But considering many are sprinting, and there's not a lot on the agenda, I'd suggest we skip today's meeting?
[15:40] <sarnold> wfm
[15:40] <eslerm> +1
[15:40] <slyon> I just briefly checked our queues and it's looking pretty empty
[15:40] <sarnold> nice
[15:41] <sarnold> .. at least I hope it isn't the outrush before a tsunami
[15:42] <slyon> Yeah, let's hope it stays calm like this.
[15:43] <slyon> component-mismatches don't show anything new, but there's still some time until import freeze :)
