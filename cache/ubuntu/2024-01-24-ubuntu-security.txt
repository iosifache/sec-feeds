[12:15] <mdeslaur> arraybolt3: thanks! looking at it now
[19:27] <arraybolt3> looks like I have today only if I want to get TigerVNC out the door for Lunar :P am I in time?
[19:36] <mdeslaur> arraybolt3: sure :)
[19:36] <mdeslaur> I can publish it tomorrow too
[19:39] <arraybolt3> kk, getting the VMs set up now (this will take a while but I should be done before the end of today)
[19:40] <mdeslaur> cool, I'll publish them first thing tomorrow morning, before we shoot lunar in the head :)
[19:42] <mdeslaur> (in back of the security team barn)
[19:47] <arraybolt3> grief
[21:33] <teward> mdeslaur: i want in on some of that action. *brings the incendiary rounds for the deed*
[21:34] <mdeslaur> teward: whoa, we're just putting it out of its misery, not burning the whole barn down!
[21:35] <teward> :P
[21:36] <arraybolt3> when was teward ever about *not* burning the whole barn down?
[21:36] <arraybolt3> *ducks*
[21:36] <teward> *puts arraybolt3 in the salt mines*
[21:36] <mdeslaur> arraybolt3: ah, true :)
[21:38] <teward> well if the barn catches fire then we have to build a better barn :P
[21:42] <arraybolt3> sheesh so it took me like 30 minutes to figure out how on earth to get TigerVNC working because the documentation was so scattered. I literally had to resort to the Arch Wiki to get it going.
[21:43] <arraybolt3> anyway currently installing Lunar, then going to go to Jammy and Focal, these should go *fairly* fast.
