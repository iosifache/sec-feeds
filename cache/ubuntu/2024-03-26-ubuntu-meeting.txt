[15:34] <slyon> *trace* got re-assigned within Foundations this week and is actively being worked on this pulse.
[15:35] <slyon> bpf* Got security ACK. Needs double-checking by cpaelzer to validate the MIR remarks are resolved
[15:35] <slyon> jaraco.text and python-openstacksdk seem ready
[15:36] <sarnold> nice nice

[15:38] <slyon> gnome-snapshort seems to be ready, too. Already got promoted.
[15:38] <slyon> seb128: on the gnome-snapshot MIR: It looks like you demoted "cheese", but it is back in main again. Could you please double-check?

[15:39] <sarnold> nice catch re cheese
[15:39] <seb128> slyon, I think we need an upload of ubuntu-desktop which didn't happen yet
[15:39] <slyon> seb128: ok. I assume your team will be tracking this
[15:39] <seb128> yes
[15:39] <slyon> thx!
[15:40]  * slyon left a comment on that bug

[15:42] <slyon> Requested changes got landed in Debian. It should be ready once they land in Ubuntu, but are not a priority right now, IIUC. I'd like to see didrocks' confirmation on this.

[15:43] <slyon> bug #2023971
[15:43] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2023971 in libmail-dmarc-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libmail-dmarc-perl" [High, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2023971
[15:44] <slyon> libmail-dmarc-perl is an interesting one.
[15:45] <eslerm_> Security is aiming to complete a review for libemail-mime-perl by Thursday
[15:45] <slyon> eslerm_: That's great. thanks!
[15:45] <eslerm_> unless using libmail-dmarc-perl as packaged in proposed is preferred
[15:45] <slyon> The only thing remaining IIUC would be the duplication issue: libemail-mime-perl & libmime-tools-perl in main
[15:46] <slyon> well well... I don't know. We can make a call between duplicated work because of two similar packages in "main". Or extra work because of carrying non-mainstream patches.
[15:46] <sarnold> one of the comments on https://github.com/msimerson/mail-dmarc/pull/217 suggested that the original requirements are also requirements for spamassassin 4.0, so suddenly it feels more plausible to use the original requirements..
[15:46] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Pull 217 in msimerson/mail-dmarc "use MIME::Entity and MIME::Parser from MIME::Tools instead of Email::MIME" [Open]
[15:47] <slyon> I don't know what's better and would like to deferr that call to the server team, as they own both of those packages.
[15:47] <slyon> (CC cpaelzer ^)
[15:48] <slyon> sarnold: that suggests we should be using libemail-mime-perl after all?
[15:48] <sarnold> slyon: yeah. it's a complex choice.
[15:49] <slyon> I'll update the case on LP, as I'd like to wait for server-team input
[15:49] <sarnold> I was really impressed with mirespace's patch to switch out the dependencies, it looked ideal, but then it felt like we'll eventually need the original packages "soon" anyway..
[15:49] <sarnold> sounds good
[15:52]  * slyon commented
[15:52] <slyon> bug #2015538
[15:52] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2015538 in dbus-broker (Ubuntu) "[MIR] dbus-broker" [Undecided, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2015538
[15:53] <sarnold> oh lots of conversation since I last looked
[15:53] <slyon> turns out there is a hard dependency between dbus-run-session and dbus-daemon. So we cannot do a simple package split
[15:53] <slyon> So this needs to be postponed to next cycle, as we need extra engineering time to come up with a solution.
[15:54] <slyon> eslerm_: can you clarify your comment on bug #2056099 ?
[15:54] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2056099 in tree (Ubuntu) "[MIR] tree" [Undecided, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2056099
[15:54] <slyon> Are you saying we don't need security ACK for NN promotion?
[15:55] <eslerm_> this might explain best: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nbd/+bug/2054480/comments/7
[15:55] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2054480 in nbd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] nbd-client" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:55] <eslerm_> I just wanted to note these for future cycles
[15:56] <slyon> I understand for nbd, which was in main for a long time and probably never got security review.
[15:57] <slyon> but for src:tree it's a new decision, no?
[15:57] <eslerm_> I'll leave it to Seth if Security wants to review
[15:58] <slyon> Oh! It's because of the MIR assessment: "This does not need a security review"
[15:58] <eslerm_> yes :)
[15:58] <eslerm_> I'm not saying we need to review these for NN
[15:58] <slyon> joalif: is that something you'd be willing to change for the "tree" MIR?
[15:58] <slyon> ok
[15:58] <eslerm_> I just don't want it to be a pattern for OO
[15:58] <slyon> joalif: nvm :)
[15:59] <slyon> Well it's always a hard call for us MIR reviewers, as we don't have a security background. But we try to rather be safe and ask for security-review if in doubt
[16:00] <sarnold>   register void *value = malloc (size);
[16:00] <eslerm_> it's understandable :pray:
[16:00] <sarnold> oh wow this thing is *ancient* :)
[16:01] <sarnold> at least it's using ansi c prototypes, but 'register', I haven't seen that in live code in ages, hehe
[16:01] <slyon> eslerm_: sarnold: If you have bad feelings about security-review bypassing of a specific package, please always reach out to the MIR reviewer. We might not always be aware of the side-effects.
[16:02] <eslerm_> ++1
[16:02] <sarnold> ack, thanks slyon
[16:02] <slyon> ok. I left a quick comments on the "tree" MIR, as it's still lacking tests
[16:02] <slyon> moving on..
[16:02] <slyon> bug #2054480
[16:02] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2054480 in nbd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] nbd-client" [Undecided, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2054480
[16:04] <slyon> I'd like to get didrocks opinion on nbd-client, to see if his concerns are resolved.
[16:04] <slyon> bug #2048781
[16:04] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2048781 in authd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] authd" [Undecided, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2048781
[16:04] <eslerm_> very nice add to authd didrocks :)
[16:05] <slyon> Here Didier added a ncie "cargo-vendor-filterer" tool, to get rid of windows* crates during package build
[16:05] <slyon> I think this is a good approach for now, until we can come up with a centralized solution
[16:06] <slyon> pending security review.
[16:06] <sarnold> awesome <3

[16:18] <didrocks> slyon: eslerm_: yeah, quite happy with the finale solution (even if not ideal). Iâm happy to liaison on this with the toolchain team during the next sprint

[20:13] <rbasak> yw!
[20:14] <rbasak> amurray, vorlon in particular, but also maybe relevant for the others: note that the agenda states "London time" and so the next meeting will be presumably in DST and therefore will shift relative to UTC.
[20:14] <rbasak> (is that correct?)
[20:19] <vorlon> yes that will be helpful to me, I currently have a conflict with a standup ):
[20:19] <vorlon> :)
[20:19] <vorlon> (because of the US already switching)
[20:20] <vorlon> taking aac-tactics
[20:29] <vorlon> heh
[20:34] <amurray> yep I'll try to remember to wake up an hour earlier next time
[20:35] <amurray> oh it will be 2 hours earlier since DST ends here too
