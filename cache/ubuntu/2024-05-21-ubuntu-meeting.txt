[14:34] <slyon> o/ Do we have quorum for a MIR meeting? I see some people are out..
[14:36] <dviererbe> Doesn't look like it :/
[14:39] <jbicha> heads up that Desktop is working on filing a MIR for sysprof (bug 2066269) which will have 2 dependent MIRs. I expect it will need Security review
[14:39] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2066269 in sysprof (Ubuntu) "[MIR] sysprof" [Undecided, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2066269
[14:39] <slyon> status looks pretty much as last time (2 weeks ago). A much of component mismatches, mostly for openstack and desktop teams, but also one new for foundations. One request to promote a split out package from desktop and the heads up from jbicha ^
[14:39] <slyon> Otherwise, no updates
[14:39] <slyon> thanks jbicha for raising it early!
[14:40] <slyon> Let's meet next week, when everybody is back again.

[19:07] <seb128> ack
[19:07] <sil2100> (he's also marked as OoO)
[19:08] <seb128> (to be fair I was expecting even less people to show since it's post Canonical travel week(s))
[19:08] <seb128> #action everyone to review the third party repo draft within a week and raise any comments they have, after that Robie will post to discourse

[19:08] <seb128> ACTION: rbasak to open wider discussion on third-party repo policy
[19:08] <seb128> in fact that's probably the one that we should keep?
[19:08] <amurray> yeah I think so
[19:09] <seb128> #undo
[19:09] <meetingology> Removing item from minutes: ACTION
[19:09] <seb128> unsure how that syntax is working :/
[19:09] <seb128> I will just edit the wiki manually
[19:09] <seb128> #action rbasak to open wider discussion on third-party repo policy
[19:09] <meetingology> ACTION: rbasak to open wider discussion on third-party repo policy
[19:10] <seb128> ACTION: rbasak to draft a proposal of the DMB-proposed inactivity expiration policy for TB ratification
[19:10] <seb128> Robie is not there and that didn't move afaik so carrying over

[19:11] <seb128> ACTION: vorlon to follow up on the Cinnamon 24.04 LTS Qualification re the number of contacts listed for the flavor
[19:12] <sil2100> Didn't hear anything about that sadly
[19:12] <sil2100> The isotracker manifest only has one person for now
[19:12] <seb128> unsure if that still makes sense to follow up since we are past LTS and we vote in favor of it
[19:13] <seb128> would still be nice to see that raised and changed if possible though
[19:13] <seb128> let's carry over, we can drop next time when Steve is around if needed
