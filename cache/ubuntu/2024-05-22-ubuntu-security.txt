[07:58] <LocutusOfBorg> hello, is anybody trying or working to update openssl?
[07:59] <LocutusOfBorg> nodejs needs openssl 3.2
[07:59] <LocutusOfBorg> schopin, ^^
[08:00] <schopin> LocutusOfBorg: do they need >= 3.2 or == 3.2 ?
[08:02] <schopin> also, you want adrien now. These days he's the lead on all things crypto for Foundations, I'm just the backup singer.
[08:05] <LocutusOfBorg> is adrien somewhere on irc?
[08:05] <LocutusOfBorg> well, I don't know, probably <= 3.2 is good
[08:05] <LocutusOfBorg> >=
[08:06] <LocutusOfBorg> I'm disabling some openssl test that are failing, and I have some guess that they won't fail with newer openssl

[17:48] <UnivrslSuprBox> LocutusOfBorg: You've probably got it by now, but adrien is available in -release and -devel.
[18:41] <LocutusOfBorg> yep thanks
