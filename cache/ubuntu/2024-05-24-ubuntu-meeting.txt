[10:23] <adrien> ogayot: ok, thanks; I only looked at one revdep ("google-something") and noticed it's at version 1.x and there's 2.x which is still updated; no idea about other revdeps though and it doesn't mean it's not more sensible to patch the package now and do the migration over a long timeframe (I'll see next week, I'm off until tuesday)
