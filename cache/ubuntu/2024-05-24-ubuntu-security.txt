[00:19] <JanC> it might not be a major or easy to exploit issue...
[00:20] <JanC> (so not "critical")
[00:31] <sarnold> expat gets linked into a lot of things though
[00:31] <sarnold> so it might be limited only by creativity, heh
[01:00] <amurray> mcphail: no need to apologise here - we are the ones dragging the chain - fyi there seems to be some confusion internally around this issue so I am continuing to liase with the development team to get to a conclusion
[05:56] <brittluna> amurray: listening to this weeks Ubuntu Security Podcast now, while applying security updates on the Ubuntu servers at work in Sweden from the partner in England atm :p
[07:10] <ricotz> mdeslaur, hi :), please retry https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security-proposed/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/+build/28486484
[07:12] <amurray> ricotz: done
[07:17] <ricotz> thx
[07:42] <mcphail> amurray: thanks. I'll check in again in a couple of weeks if I haven't heard anything in the meantime
[10:31] <ricotz> another retry needed for https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security-proposed/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/+build/28486482
[11:36] <ebarretto> ricotz, done 
[11:54] <ricotz> ebarretto, thx, launchpad builders are quite unhappy today, the build failed again https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security-proposed/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/+build/28486482
[11:58] <ebarretto> ricotz, yeah :/ I re-trigger it again, let me know if it fails again 
[12:16] <ricotz> ebarretto, thank you, I will try to keep an eye on them
[14:20] <mdeslaur> anybody here use unbound? I have some packages that I appreciate getting some testing on... https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security-proposed/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/+packages
[14:20] <mdeslaur> amavisd-new also in the same repo
[14:33] <sdeziel> mdeslaur: happy to test amavisd-new (sad that I'm still using that piece of software) on Jammy
[14:36] <mdeslaur> sdeziel: awesome! that would be great
[14:40] <sdeziel> mdeslaur: amavisd-new on Jammy (`1:2.12.2-1ubuntu1.1`) has no problem doing DKIM verification/signing and otherwise inspecting mails for spam. I did not specifically test this new `CC_UNCHECKED,3` bit though
[14:44] <mdeslaur> sdeziel: great, thanks for the test!
[14:45] <mdeslaur> IOU $BEER
[14:51] <sdeziel> huh, so I'd get a free security fix and $BEER, that's a way to make people happy :P
[15:04] <mdeslaur> hehehe
