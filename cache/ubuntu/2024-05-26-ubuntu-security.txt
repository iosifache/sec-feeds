[22:35] <NovaShadow> hey, just wanted if you guys have ever successfully filtered outbound traffic with iptables. I'm struggling to get apt[-get] data in and out while not wholeheartedly permitting 80,443 traffic. +10 points if you've done so using -m owner --uid -_-
[22:56] <arraybolt3> NovaShadow: I wasn't even able to do NAT with iptables :P
[22:56] <arraybolt3> but this is probably the wrong channel. You might try EITHER #ubuntu OR #networking (don't cross-post to both).
[23:16] <NovaShadow> I can probably help you with NAT
[23:17] <NovaShadow> they have an accurate account of what to do for that in arch wiki. "Simple stateful firewall."
[23:22] <NovaShadow> arraybolt3: any ideas on a tool that would let me track the process to figure out process ownership?
[23:31] <arraybolt3> NovaShadow: That's probably also an #ubuntu question.
[23:31] <arraybolt3> This is the Ubuntu Security Team's development and collaboration room, #ubuntu is the user technical support room.
[23:31] <NovaShadow> fair, thank you for your suggestion
