[00:07] <amurray> mcphail: fyi I'm expecting this to be resolved in more like 7 days than a couple of weeks - so will keep pushing on things internally and let you know asap - again, apologies for all the delays on this 
[00:12] <amurray> blahdeblah: yeah that is a great idea - it would be really interesting to do the analysis to (hopefully) show that since we rebase our kernels on the various stable trees etc that we do not suffer from this
[00:13] <blahdeblah> amurray: Yeah, my feeling after reading it was similar, and I did question their methodology a bit, but not being an expert in the area I couldn't be definitive.
[00:15] <amurray> or perhaps it would be enough just to compare open CVEs in our kernels vs RHEL (but in general I don't think anything good ever comes of doing direct comparisons with our peers, particularly if we do it and then try and say  - "look how much more secure we are") - instead would just be good to show an analysis that reassures users that Ubuntu *is* secure since we do incorporate all the patches and leave out the comparison bit

[19:30] <ahasenack> georgiag: hi, I just had a bug filed about something I wasn't expecting in apparmor rules,
[19:30] <ahasenack> georgiag: impact of usr-merge in apparmor profiles, when ugprading from pre-usr-merge distros
[19:30] <ahasenack> case in point was bionic -> focal upgrade
[19:30] <ahasenack> in fresh bionic: /bin/uname
[19:30] <ahasenack> in fresh focal: /usr/bin/uname
[19:31] <ahasenack> in focal upgraded from bionic: /bin/uname
[19:31] <ahasenack> (uname is just an example: anything in /bin/ in bionic, if present in an apparmor rule that does not use /{,usr/}, will fail in the upgraded system
[19:32] <ahasenack> I had a nice "%if bionic" in the apparmor template, and was accounting for these differences where needed, but always assuming the "fresh" installation case
[19:32] <ahasenack> this upgrade-from-bionic got me
[19:33] <ahasenack> do you remember similar bugs back in 2020 (focal's release), from people upgrading from bionic to focal? Just trying to get some an idea if there is a pattern to addressing this
[19:34] <georgiag> ahasenack: I will have to dig a little bit to find out if there are/were other cases.
[19:34] <ahasenack> no need, if you don't remember, then they were likely not important or relevant
[19:35] <georgiag> I had this issue in one of the apparmor tests actually
[19:35] <ahasenack> or common
[19:36] <georgiag> I joined in 2021 so there might be some cases I haven't looked at yet :)
[19:36] <ahasenack> hah :)
[19:42] <sdeziel> in custom made profile, this usr-merge difference on dist-upgraded machines also bit me, annoying ;)
[19:42] <ahasenack> yeah
[19:42] <ahasenack> I'm going over every bin invocation
[19:42] <ahasenack> so far it's ps and uname
[19:42] <ahasenack> ah, and systemctl
[19:43] <ahasenack> these live in /bin in bionic
