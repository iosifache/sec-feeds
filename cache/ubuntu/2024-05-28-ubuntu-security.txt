[15:03] <Asif> Hi, I opened bug 2066363 last week. Any chance someone can take a quick look >
[15:24] <leosilva> hi Asif, can i make the bug public, so the desktop team can see it?
[15:27] <Asif> yeah, go ahead. Nothing secret on there right now
[15:28] <Asif> Just saw your comment, its not on the gnome login window. credentials are shown on a console screen before you while the system switches back to the login screen
[15:28] <leosilva> thanks!
[15:40] <mdeslaur> Asif: those are the credentials you typed into gdm though, right?
[15:41] <Asif> yes, the last credentials typed into gdm are what is on the screen
