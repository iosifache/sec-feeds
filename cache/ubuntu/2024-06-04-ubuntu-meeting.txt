[14:32] <cpaelzer> abseil -> googletest on desktop
[14:32] <eslerm> o/
[14:32] <cpaelzer> IIRC they said they will have a look
[14:32] <cpaelzer> but there was jbicha saying hi
[14:32] <cpaelzer> maybe he knows a current state
[14:33] <slyon> o/
[14:33] <cpaelzer> the other are python-inflect and pytohn-arrow pointing to pytohn-typeguard and typeshed
[14:33] <cpaelzer> that was openstack and jamespage
[14:33] <cpaelzer> I didn't see a reply
[14:33] <jbicha> I haven't looked into abseil -> googletest yet
[14:33] <cpaelzer> no problem jbicha, as long as it is in your todo-queue we are ok
[14:33] <cpaelzer> the cycle is early still :-)
[14:34] <cpaelzer> I'll send a mail to jamespage in case he missed the IRC pings
[14:34] <sarnold> good morning
[14:36] <cpaelzer> mail sent

[14:36] <cpaelzer> many others wnated to do their assignment this week IIRC

[14:37] <cpaelzer> ah, that is why jbicha is here :-)
[14:37] <jamespage> o/
[14:37] <sarnold> jbicha is always here :)
[14:37] <cpaelzer> true
[14:37] <cpaelzer> but even more
[14:37] <jbicha> I plan to finish filling out https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/TestPlans/Sysprof and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/TestPlans/GnomeBuilder today
[14:38] <cpaelzer> awesome
[14:38] <cpaelzer> I can have a look at a review tomorrow
[14:38] <cpaelzer> If the test process is complete by then that would be great

[14:40] <cpaelzer> uh
[14:40] <cpaelzer> thanks jbicha
[14:40] <cpaelzer> more reviews to share then

[14:40] <cpaelzer> liiking for volunteers now
[14:40] <cpaelzer> "looking"
[14:40] <joalif> i can have one
[14:40] <cpaelzer> I also like review volunteers though
[14:41] <cpaelzer> libdex or libpanel - any preference joalif?
[14:41] <slyon> I'm off next week, but could take one for the week after.
[14:41] <cpaelzer> btw jamespage - I saw your "o/" - sorry for sending you a mail - have you seen the two mismatches above?
[14:41] <cpaelzer> ok slyon, I think that is better than no reviewer :-)
[14:41] <joalif> libdex please
[14:42] <cpaelzer> done
[14:42] <joalif> thanks
[14:43] <cpaelzer> slyon: maybe you can come to the "needs security review" yes/no this week - to enqueue it there before you are out?
[14:43] <cpaelzer> only if it is a trivial call to make, and anything in depth is fine for when you are back
[14:43] <slyon> my "distro day" for this week is almost over, not sure if I can make that
[14:43] <sarnold> good idea :)
[14:43] <cpaelzer> WDYT slyon - is that possible - or is that breaking your planned tasks before you leave?
[14:43] <cpaelzer> slyon: ok, give it a best effort try if you can
[14:43] <slyon> ok
[14:44] <cpaelzer> not wasting time discussing it further, you see sarnold would appreciate it :-)
[14:44] <cpaelzer> no recent incomplete bug updates, going on

[14:46] <cpaelzer> both blocked on the older libseed spelling
[14:46] <jamespage> cpaelzer: seen
[14:46] <cpaelzer> thanks jamespage
[14:46] <cpaelzer> I like both PRs, short, concise and to the point
[14:46] <cpaelzer> slyon:  has approved one already
[14:46] <slyon> just approved the 2nd one
[14:46] <cpaelzer> thanks
[14:47] <cpaelzer> I'll give both a check tomorrow
[14:47] <eslerm> thank you slyon and cpaelzer
[14:47] <cpaelzer> and if I'm +1 as well merge them and fix the silly spelling check issue
[14:47] <cpaelzer> thank you all
[14:47] <cpaelzer> going on ...

[14:47] <cpaelzer> I think we had no recent additions
[14:48] <cpaelzer> any update on those in the queue for longer?
[14:48] <slyon> I reviewed bug #2067373 today. I think it can be queued for security already, while desktop works out the kinks

[14:48] <cpaelzer> ok, I'm sure sarnold can add that there right?
[14:48] <sarnold> yup!
[14:48] <cpaelzer> sarnold: maybe an expectation on when s3transfer and boto3 will get started?
[14:50] <sarnold> cpaelzer: I expect one should start this week, unsure of how many more
[14:50] <cpaelzer> as long as they not continue to just wait we are ok atm I guess
[14:50] <cpaelzer> but you can expect some more to come to your queue
[14:50] <cpaelzer> like 3 of sysprof we've seen above are likely
[14:51] <cpaelzer> with that in mind, going on ...
[14:51] <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?
[14:51] <cpaelzer> nothing from the server team atm
[14:51] <sarnold> nothing from me

[14:52] <cpaelzer> ok, thanks
[14:52] <cpaelzer> I think we are good for today
[14:52] <joalif> thanks cpaelzer all :)
[14:52] <cpaelzer> about everyone got something to work on
[14:52] <eslerm> nothing :)
[14:52] <slyon> thanks all!
[14:52] <cpaelzer> but no one got an insane amount
[14:52] <cpaelzer> that is how it should be

[15:12] <slyon> so (probably) no need for queueing it early
[18:59] <amurray> o/
[19:02] <seb128> hey

[19:03] <seb128> hey amurray  :)
[19:03] <rbasak> o/
[19:03] <seb128> Steve was supposed to chair but sent an apologies email
[19:04] <seb128> Lukasz was supposed to be backup but doesn't seem around? (let me ping him in private in case)
[19:05] <seb128> rbasak, around?
[19:05] <rbasak> Yes
[19:06] <seb128> amurray, rbasak, I think it's only the 3 of us, worth having a quick meeting still?
[19:06] <amurray> yeah I think so
[19:06] <seb128> our chair and backup chair are missing, amurray you would be next in the list following the membership order
[19:06] <amurray> no worries
[19:06] <seb128> do you want to chair/start the meeting?
[19:06] <seb128> thx

[19:07] <amurray> vorlon sent apologies via email for the next few meetings
[19:08] <amurray> #topic Action review
[19:08] <amurray> ACTION: rbasak to open wider discussion on third-party repo policy
[19:08] <rbasak> I've been working on this.
[19:08] <rbasak> I've been editing the draft.
[19:08] <rbasak> The most recent significant changes are:
[19:09] <rbasak> 1. The requirement for the documented test plan
[19:09] <rbasak> 2. The section on specific mechanism for implementation for snaps via snap channels.
[19:09] <rbasak> These are marked in green in the draft.
[19:10] <rbasak> Final call: if you haven't provided feedback yet, I'm going to assume you're OK with the current wording (as a draft for publication for consultation; there would still be a final TB ratification step).
[19:10] <rbasak> Also please note that I've renumbered the requirements and started calling them "principles" to help with clarity
[19:10] <amurray> sounds reasonable
[19:11] <amurray> #link https://docs.google.com/document/d/1apUKR4gtOrfPGCWmtoebaQUhoy-fG8Cyo3VKJyhnpD0/edit
[19:12] <amurray> new changes lgtm fwiw
[19:12] <seb128> +1 from me also
[19:12] <rbasak> Thanks!
[19:13] <rbasak> I've also been speaking to some internal stakeholders such as snap upstream.
[19:13] <rbasak> Assuming no objections from them, I'll publish to Discourse in the next couple of weeks or so.
[19:13] <rbasak> My draft to post to Discourse is in progress in the same doc.
[19:13] <amurray> sounds good - thanks rbasak
[19:14] <amurray> (argh sorry I just realised I have a hard stop in 15 mins so will speed things up a bit - apologies)
[19:14] <amurray> ACTION: rbasak to draft a proposal of the DMB-proposed inactivity expiration policy for TB ratification
[19:14] <rbasak> This is a lower priority so I've not touched it. Please carry over.
[19:14] <seb128> (sounds fine, I don't expect there is any pending topic that should turn it into a long meeting)

[19:15] <rbasak> Hopefully you've all seen the call for nominations.
[19:15] <rbasak> I will send a reminder out tomorrow.
[19:15] <amurray> yep - thanks rbasak

[19:19] <sil2100> Apologies, I completely lost count of time
[19:19] <sil2100> Oh no
[19:20] <amurray> all good - main thing to know would be to raise any issues you have may with the third-party repo requirements doc asap
[19:20] <sil2100> I'll check the meeting logs, but anything high-profile I should know about?
