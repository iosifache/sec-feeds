[14:37] <cpaelzer> is a more recent update
[14:37] <cpaelzer> which is pushing it to post oracular
[14:38] <cpaelzer> I was hoping for it, but yeah it is what it is and I do not have resources to change it - so I won't complain at others for the same

[14:40] <cpaelzer> slyon said yes already
[14:40] <cpaelzer> anyone wants to stop me from merging?
[14:41] <cpaelzer> hmm, today is a monologue :-/
[14:41] <cpaelzer> merging in 10
[14:41] <cpaelzer> 5
[14:41] <cpaelzer> anyone still reading?
[14:42] <sarnold> guten abend :)
[14:42] <cpaelzer> hehe
[14:42] <cpaelzer> sarnold: joalif: - or guests jbicha and dviererbe - any input on this?
[14:42] <sarnold> cpaelzer: I hit the approve button a few minutes ago :)
[14:43] <cpaelzer> lol
[14:43] <cpaelzer> thanks
[14:43] <cpaelzer> merging ...
[14:43] <jbicha> could you clarify what you mean about webkit?
[14:44] <cpaelzer> the old line (from before my days) was
[14:44] <cpaelzer> TODO: - no dependency on webkit, qtwebkit or libseed
[14:44] <cpaelzer> it actually was back then just saying "seed" at the end
[14:44] <dviererbe> cpaelzer: Look reasonable to me
[14:44] <cpaelzer> which many Ubuntu folks considered to be these seeds https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeedManagement
[14:44] <cpaelzer> so I clarified libseed a while ago
[14:45] <jbicha> webkit2gtk only gets security support for like 3 years and is security sensitive so maybe it's worth being cautious about what stuff is using webkitgtk
[14:45] <cpaelzer> but we still had discussion sometimes on "why no webkit, qtwebkit or libseed"
[14:45] <cpaelzer> so I tried to outline that a bit
[14:45] <jbicha> documented at https://docs.webkit.org/Ports/WebKitGTK%20and%20WPE%20WebKit/DependenciesPolicy.html
[14:46] <cpaelzer> uh, thanks for knowing more
[14:46] <cpaelzer> reading ...
[14:46] <jbicha> we probably don't document that detail very well on the Ubuntu side, sorry
[14:46] <cpaelzer> jbicha: this is great still
[14:46] <jbicha> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/webkit2gtk
[14:47] <cpaelzer> jbicha: would you consider it possible to extend on my PR with adding these for context?
[14:47] <jbicha> webkitgtk doesn't really provide security updates for previous "major" releases (and the release cycle is basically the same as GNOME's)
[14:47] <cpaelzer> I tried to make it more clear why we care about avoiding these dependencies - and my text does so. But with your references it would be even more understandable
[14:48] <jbicha> yes, I can add to my todo list
[14:48] <cpaelzer> thank you in advance
[14:49] <cpaelzer> going on in the agenda
[14:49] <cpaelzer> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

[14:50] <cpaelzer> that is good news still
[14:50] <cpaelzer> thanks sarnold
[14:50] <sarnold> I expect to review those today and get those off the lists within the next day or so
[14:52] <cpaelzer> great
