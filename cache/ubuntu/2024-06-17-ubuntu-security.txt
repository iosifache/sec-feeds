[15:54] <tsimonq2> Hi, I'm thinking we might want the fix for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/noble/+source/plasma-workspace/+bug/2067742 in noble-security.
[15:54] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- Launchpad bug 2067742 in plasma-workspace (Ubuntu Noble) "[SRU] CVE-2024-36041 Fix ksmserver: Unauthorized users can access session manager" [Undecided, New]
[15:55] <tsimonq2> CVE-2024-36041

[15:55] <tsimonq2> Thoughts?
[16:47] <ahasenack> georgiag: hi, apparmor question. If I have a profile loaded into the kernel already, let's say, called containers-default-0.57.4. And a bunch of containers are running already, and confined by it
[16:48] <ahasenack> what happens if I replace that profile, i.e., load it again into the kernel, same name, different contents? That will dynamically apply to the containers that are already running and confined by it, right?
[17:04] <georgiag> ahasenack: right, apparmor does support live replacement of policy
[17:09] <teward> tsimonq2: i think that's a prime security update candidate, but not sure what others think - mdeslaur among others, thoughts?
[17:15] <mdeslaur_> tsimonq2, teward yeah, that should be fixed in all our stable releases...providing debdiffs and subscribing ubuntu-security-sponsors would be the way forward (it's in universe)
[17:18] <teward> tsimonq2: looks like you got voluntold to provide diffs xD
[22:15] <UnivrslSuprBox> Did someone accidentally reverse the ordering on https://ubuntu.com/security/notices? USN-1-1 is first in the list
[22:38] <tsimonq2> mdeslaur_: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/noble/+source/plasma-workspace/+bug/2067742 here you are :)
