[17:07] <tsimonq2> mdeslaur: Just finished testing updates for the plasma-workspace CVE, should be good.
[17:08] <tsimonq2> That riscv64 segfault for Mantic is ... odd.
[17:16] <mdeslaur> awesome, thanks tsimonq2 
[17:17] <mdeslaur> yeah, I tried mashing the retry button a few times, but I've given up now, it doesn't matter, Mantic will be pushing up daisies soon
[17:18] <mdeslaur> tsimonq2: I'll publish the updates first thing tomorrow
[18:14] <tsimonq2> mdeslaur: Awesome, thank you! :)
