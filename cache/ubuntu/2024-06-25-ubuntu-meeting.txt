[14:35] <cpaelzer> jamespage: that is still the set of openstack cases
[14:35] <cpaelzer> jamespage: you can be happy that we are so far away from any freeze, so it isn't urgent
[14:35] <cpaelzer> but I kind of get deja-vu seeing it every week
[14:35] <slyon> cpaelzer: IIRC it was delegated to some people from his team.
[14:35] <jamespage> I have volunteers to work the MIR for those - I will raise them and assign so its clear
[14:35] <cpaelzer> I thought so as well, but expected to have bugs by now then
[14:35] <cpaelzer> perfect
[14:35] <slyon> Maybe a dummy LP bug should be created and linked, so that we don't have to go over that every week
[14:36] <cpaelzer> let me throw you two bugs then jamespage
[14:36] <cpaelzer> and you can assign as you go with them
[14:36] <jamespage> thanks - I'll push them out accordingly
[14:36] <cpaelzer> uh
[14:36] <cpaelzer> they exist
[14:36] <cpaelzer> but are not picked up
[14:36] <sarnold> that'll just change the section of the meeting, no? :)
[14:36] <cpaelzer> checking ...

[14:37] <slyon> I supposed ~ubuntu-mir needs to be subscribed?
[14:37] <cpaelzer> yep, done by now
[14:37] <slyon> sarnold: yeah, but if it's a bug stating "TBD", we can just skip over it without thinking about it :)
[14:37] <cpaelzer> nothing else in this list for today
[14:38] <cpaelzer> exactly @slyon
[14:38] <cpaelzer> We had wsdd come into the queue earlier, but I grabbed and handled it as seb128 asked for this to go to security asap
[14:38] <cpaelzer> which it is by now

[14:39] <cpaelzer> last update was on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libpanel/+bug/2066272 which was a review done
[14:39] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2066272 in libpanel (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libpanel" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[14:39] <cpaelzer> nothing else that is super recent
[14:39]  * slyon is afraid that things are feeling too calm this (early) cycle
[14:39] <cpaelzer> hehe
[14:39] <cpaelzer> AFAICS many teams do more 24.04.x work, so it won't show here for oracular
[14:39] <cpaelzer> but in e.g. increased SRU activity
[14:39] <cpaelzer> but that is gut feeling, not data
[14:40] <slyon> yeah libpanel has some TODOs for jbicha
[14:40] <cpaelzer> yep
[14:40] <cpaelzer> wsdd also had some needs (as expected)
[14:40] <cpaelzer> but ok in general
[14:40] <slyon> tests not running properly, otherwise LGTM

[14:41] <cpaelzer> have a look, if we can get 1-2 +1 I can merge right away
[14:42] <slyon> +1
[14:42] <cpaelzer> Thanks, anyone still reading or should I merge (this is a fairly calm change, just clarifying better)
[14:43] <sarnold> +1
[14:43] <cpaelzer> thanks, merged
[14:43] <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue
[14:43] <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?

[14:44] <cpaelzer> sarnold: did you see wsdd come in already?
[14:44] <sarnold> cpaelzer: I added it a few seconds ago
[14:44] <sarnold> (thanks to your hint)
[14:44] <slyon> sarnold: There's also bug #2069308 as of today, which should go to security review already, as the requested changes are fairly simple packaging things
[14:44] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2069308 in xdg-terminal-exec (Ubuntu) "MIR xdg-terminal-exec" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2069308
[14:45] <sarnold> hunh i'm not sure I knew xterm wasn't in main, heh
[14:46] <cpaelzer> this one is in https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security/+bugs?field.searchtext=%5BMIR%5D&assignee_option=choose&field.assignee=ubuntu-security&field.bug_reporter=&field.bug_commenter=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir but not yet in the jira board
[14:46] <sarnold> so, due to turnover, we won't have the throughput that we did last cycle; I'll try to find some assistance but things are feeling tight
[14:46] <cpaelzer> so much for things being too calm
[14:46] <sarnold> aye, a bit more calm would be just the thing :)
[14:46] <cpaelzer> and indeed the backlog starts to front-load
[14:46] <sarnold> yay for that
[14:47] <cpaelzer> 5 waiting to be grabbed
[14:47] <cpaelzer> do you need help in raising a concern, or is it not that bad yet?
[14:47] <slyon> I guess the xdg-terminal-exec can be handled with lower priority. They didn't mention a specific deadline IIRC
[14:47] <sarnold> not that bad yet, holidays have also interrupted the regular communication channels
[14:47] <cpaelzer> ok
[14:48] <cpaelzer> let us watch that if that means 4 weeks for review (not nice but ok) or 12 weeks (a problem I guess)
[14:48] <cpaelzer> for now, leaving this in the hands of sarnold
[14:48] <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?
[14:49] <sarnold> just a small bit ..
[14:49] <slyon> sil2100 and myself were wondering about pulseaudio this morning..
[14:49] <cpaelzer> slyon: what is the status of pulseaudio that you wondered about?
[14:49] <slyon> src:pulseaudio is in main, but most binaries have been dropped, somehow they are still being pulled in images, which leaves us in a strange situation.
[14:49] <cpaelzer> I miagine sarnold is typing more than a small bit as it still goes on
[14:50] <sarnold> sometimes questions are floating in space about "hey one of our partners wants such-and-such included, how do we do it?" -- while our giant pile of TODOs is well-suited for our review needs, it feels like a poor fit for "how do I get something included into ubuntu" or "how do I get a new package supported by canonical"
[14:50] <slyon> Does anybody know if we still need pulseaudio in main at all? or what's happening here? CC jbicha, didrocks
[14:50] <jbicha> slyon: we definitely need some pulseaudio stuff in main, it's being handled (hopefully today)
[14:51] <slyon> jbicha: oh, good to know! So binaries were demoted by accident?
[14:51] <jbicha> I haven't been able to find any logs that explain how some binaries got demoted everywhere but on armhf
[14:51] <sarnold> does anyone else see a need for a more packager-oriented guide? or is the current review documentation sufficient for the task, if not ideal?
[14:52] <slyon> sarnold: I wonder if this could be one section of the new packaging-guide? cc dviererbe
[14:52] <cpaelzer> jbicha: thanks, we'll wait for what you find then
[14:52] <cpaelzer> sarnold: I wanted to write the same
[14:52] <sarnold> I don't intend for us to solve this today ;) but I just thought I'd put the idea out there, to see if anyone else sees this, or may see this over the course of the cycle
[14:52] <jbicha> also I believe pulseaudio did not show up on component-mismatches because the binaries were still in main on armhf
[14:52] <slyon> sarnold: I agree that having a higher level overview would be good.
[14:52] <cpaelzer> sarnold: but not so much in re-writing the same to have redundancy and mismatches. More to write an intro for those not knowing much about it referring to our page for the gritty details
[14:52] <slyon> which then references the ubuntu-mir template with all the specific TODOs
[14:53] <slyon> exactly
[14:53] <cpaelzer> slyon: might be able to carry that into the backlog of the packaging guide which is in the Foundations Jira?
[14:53] <cpaelzer> there are many stories about what could be written about, this would be one more
[14:53] <sarnold> a "new packaging guide" sounds like an excellent place to put this :)
[14:53] <cpaelzer> or dviererbe?
[14:54] <slyon> I'll reach out to dviererbe, trying to get that into some backlog :)
[14:54] <sarnold> I tend to stumble over these conversations in places where the question may be overlooked entirely
[14:54] <cpaelzer> thanks
[14:54] <sarnold> and hanging it on osmething like a new packaging guide feels likely to reach the right audience
[14:54] <sarnold> thanks
[14:54] <cpaelzer> correct
[14:54] <cpaelzer> any other AOB?
[14:54] <sarnold> nothing else
[14:55] <slyon> nothing
[14:55] <cpaelzer> nothing from me either
[14:55] <cpaelzer> jbicha: joalif: jamespage: last chance to add something else ... :-)
[14:55] <jbicha> nothing from me, thanks
[14:56] <joalif> nothing from me
