[18:38] <tomreyn> regarding regresshion, should the USN point out that users should daemon-reload, or does it do so automatically?
[18:39] <tomreyn> i'm happy to check the code myself unless you already know
[18:40] <tomreyn> ^ please ignore, i doubt dameon-reload is needed because there is (most likely) no configuration change
