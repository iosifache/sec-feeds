[09:56] <LocutusOfBorg> hello, what is the plan for curl and http3?
[09:56] <LocutusOfBorg> is it ok for security team to support, right?
[09:57] <LocutusOfBorg> right now the build is blocked by nghttp3 and ngtcp2 needing to build and be accepted by ubuntu-archive
[09:57] <LocutusOfBorg> but I guess they will both require a MIR in case we want http3 support in curl
[09:57] <LocutusOfBorg> please let me know if your plan differs, because I'm quite sure this is a security topic to be discussed
=== Juesto is now known as Juest
[13:20] <mdeslaur> LocutusOfBorg: someone will have to file MIR bugs for those two components, yes....not sure if anyone has done yet, or is planning to
