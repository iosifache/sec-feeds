[12:39] <mcphail> ebarretto: thanks for the explanation yesterday. I wrote a little post about my confusion: https://gld.mcphail.uk/posts/ubuntu-security-updates-are-a-confusing-mess/ . Hope it is useful feedback about how confusing this can be for users like me
[13:04] <ebarretto> mcphail: thanks, I will forward it internally 
[13:06] <mcphail> Thank you :)
[15:41] <hwpplayer1> hello
[16:43] <teward> ebarretto: just because my brain is fubar, Ubuntu Members have that '5 free' upped to 50 still right?  I thought it was some obscenely high number for members.
[16:46] <ebarretto> teward: good question, I remember there was a difference in number but don't remember the exact figures, if you want I can ask around
[16:49] <teward> ebarretto: ye i don't remember the difference if it was 20 or 50 or whatever, and i don't remember if it was documented in the Pro side of things (like the CC requested numerous times)
[16:49] <teward> ebarretto: if you're not busy and want to ask around feel free
[16:49] <teward> otherwise don't worry about it
[16:49] <JanC> it's 50: https://ubuntu.com/community/membership
[16:50] <teward> that answers that question :D
[16:50] <teward> JanC: thanks
[16:50] <JanC> https://ubuntu.com/pro also mentions this
[16:50] <teward> ah good they did finally update that :D
[16:50] <teward> yay!  i can rest easy now. *goes to find the nearest caffeine source to consume it all*
[16:51] <ebarretto> JanC: thanks!
