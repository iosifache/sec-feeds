[14:33] <cpaelzer> uh
[14:33] <cpaelzer> a lot today
[14:34] <cpaelzer> I feel we have talked udisk2 -> exfatprogs last time
[14:34] <sarnold> "But fakeroot FTBFS on armhf/oracular" .. how..?
[14:34] <sarnold> exfatprogs feels new to me
[14:34] <sarnold> I don't see it in /lastlog
[14:34] <cpaelzer> me neither
[14:35] <cpaelzer> maybe it was years ago
[14:35] <sarnold> ah that can happen :)
[14:35] <didrocks> yeah, sounds new to me too
[14:35] <cpaelzer> udisk2 is desktop - jbicha or didrocks - can you have a look what you want to do with thta
[14:35] <cpaelzer> now to the long list in -proposed
[14:35] <didrocks> Iâll defer to jbicha and track it if itâs not handled
[14:35] <slyon> no fakeroot is new
[14:35] <cpaelzer> rust pulls in docs and that pullsin  fonts and JS
[14:35] <slyon> I marked it as false-positive
[14:36] <cpaelzer> we asked for an auto-exclude last time, that already existed
[14:36] <cpaelzer> so it is about demoting the -doc
[14:36] <cpaelzer> which didn't happen
[14:36] <cpaelzer> is that otherwise ready to move? checking excuses ...
[14:36] <slyon> cpaelzer: I did the extra-exclude for rust-docs... but the -doc package needs demotion, so far no AA did it for me, could you?
[14:36] <cpaelzer> I will slyon
[14:36] <slyon> thx
[14:36] <cpaelzer> also  main cannot depend on libstd-rust-1.76-dev in universe
[14:37] <cpaelzer> which also needs movement
[14:37] <cpaelzer> but is covered by the former MIRs
[14:37] <cpaelzer> ...
[14:37] <cpaelzer> more of the same
[14:37] <sarnold> i'm surprised that doesn't show up in this report
[14:37] <cpaelzer> there are also autopkgtest issues, so it won't move even if I fix where they live
[14:38] <cpaelzer> next is freeradius
[14:38] <cpaelzer> I'll carry this to the server team
[14:39] <cpaelzer> libusbmuxd -> libimobildedevuce-glue
[14:39] <cpaelzer> that is desktop
[14:39] <cpaelzer> jbicha: didrocks ^^ could you make someone have a look please to file a bug or resolve the reason it is pulled in?
[14:39] <cpaelzer> next is websockify by openstack
[14:39] <cpaelzer> jamespage: ^^ is that expected?
[14:40] <cpaelzer> python-redis sounds intense for something that just websockifies
[14:40] <didrocks> cpaelzer: ack
[14:40] <cpaelzer> python-jsonschema also is for openstack jamespage
[14:40] <cpaelzer> It seems one of you merged a bunch :-)
[14:41] <jamespage> yep aware
[14:41] <cpaelzer> thanks jamespage thanks didrocks
[14:42] <cpaelzer> just a sec
[14:43] <cpaelzer> all others are known too

[14:45] <slyon> I can
[14:45] <cpaelzer> slyon: you or me - should I throw a coin?
[14:45] <slyon> throw the coin ;-)

[14:45] <didrocks999> if it doesnât need to be this week, I can maybe handle it next one

[14:48] <didrocks999> sarnold: thanks! I wonât have to wait for an hour to have irclogs updated :)
[14:48] <slyon> I'd still like to see an update to the most recent version
[14:48] <cpaelzer> the update only is referring to dependencies
[14:48] <sarnold> :)
[14:48] <cpaelzer> it is still incomplete
[14:48] <cpaelzer> I assume jbicha will come back to use once it is ready

[14:49] <cpaelzer> sarnold: you said progress is slow and time is scarce - any improvement?
=== didrocks999 is now known as didrocks
[14:50] <sarnold> cpaelzer: a little, I had another conversation with management yesterday, who have promised some movement -- but nothing concrete yet, I think (I haven't checked scrollback yet this morning)
[14:50] <cpaelzer> I see the backlog growing relative to the things in progress
[14:50] <cpaelzer> we know two more currently in MIR review that likely will be added
[14:51] <cpaelzer> there is not much more to be said
[14:51] <cpaelzer> hoping for you to get people or time and if possible both sarnold
[14:51] <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?
[14:51] <slyon> nothing for me
[14:51] <sarnold> none here
[14:51] <cpaelzer> you all please raise awareness in your respective teams of the coming feature freeze in less than a month
[14:51] <sarnold> *gasp*
[14:51] <cpaelzer> yes, time flies that fast
[14:52] <cpaelzer> nothing else from me today
[14:52] <cpaelzer> didrocks: jamespage: anything you need to raise?
[14:52] <cpaelzer> or joalif if you read this today?
[14:52] <didrocks> nothing either. Iâll have some forwarding to do :)
[14:52] <cpaelzer> ok
[14:52] <cpaelzer> I'll put my reminder for the AA movements
[14:52] <cpaelzer> that is all for today then
[14:52] <sarnold> I misread "do any of you need a raise?" :)
[14:52] <didrocks> heh

[19:06] <rbasak> sil2100 to follow up on the Cinnamon 24.04 LTS Qualification re the number of contacts listed for the flavor
[19:06] <sil2100> So regarding this one
=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk
[19:06] <sil2100> I'm fine in proceeding, but wanted to ask around if we still think this is necesasry
[19:07] <sil2100> Cinnamon has been labelled LTS for 24.04, if we think chasing down on this is still a valid action, I can do that
[19:07] <vorlon> I still want clarification of the contacts
[19:08] <sil2100> Fine by me, the doc does show quite a mish-mash of people there
[19:08] <vorlon> as we still need to be able to manage point releases of this flavor for years
[19:08] <sil2100> Let me start drafting an e-mail then
[19:08] <rbasak> Shall I carry this one over then?
[19:08] <sil2100> Yes please

[19:08] <rbasak> There are a couple
[19:09] <rbasak> "Ubuntu Studio Minimal ISO" from Eickmeyer
[19:09] <rbasak> #subtopic Ubuntu Studio Minimal ISO
[19:09] <rbasak> Is there any action for the TB or can it be left to the release team to handle?
[19:09] <vorlon> I think this is with the release team for now
[19:09] <rbasak> THanks
[19:10] <rbasak> #agreed There is no TB action on this at the moment. We will leave this for the release team to handle
[19:10] <meetingology> AGREED: There is no TB action on this at the moment. We will leave this for the release team to handle

[19:10] <rbasak> #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-July/002933.html
[19:11] <rbasak> What action do we need to take, if any?
[19:11] <vorlon> in this morning's release team meeting I asked that the TB be informed that a flavor has been broken for a while in devel and that the flavor contacts have not been responsive
[19:11] <vorlon> I don't think there's any action to take at this time for the TB
[19:11] <rbasak> Thanks
[19:11] <vorlon> they're not currently out of compliance w/ the release guidelines
[19:11] <rbasak> Do we need to assume that there won't be a Mate release then, going forward, unless something changes?
[19:11] <vorlon> I just don't want it to come as a surprise to anybody if they miss oracular
[19:12] <vorlon> it's currently not releasable for oracular, yes
[19:12] <rbasak> #agreed No specific TB action to take, but we won't expect there to be an Oracular release for Mate unless we make contact with their leads again
[19:12] <meetingology> AGREED: No specific TB action to take, but we won't expect there to be an Oracular release for Mate unless we make contact with their leads again
[19:12] <vorlon> oh - I see the email mentions "flavor lead", but of course the LTS qual guidelines now say there must be multiple flavor contacts :)
[19:12] <sil2100> +1
=== rbasak changed the topic of #ubuntu-meeting to: Check up on community bugs and techboard bugs
[19:13] <vorlon> I don't know who all has been contacted, I'll follow up to the mail to make sure
