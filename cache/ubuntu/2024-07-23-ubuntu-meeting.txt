[14:30] <didrocks> hey o/

[14:31] <cpaelzer> #topic current component mismatches
[14:31] <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

[14:31] <slyon> cpaelzer: did you already run any demotion on rustc-1.76-doc?
[14:31] <joalif> o/
[14:32] <cpaelzer> slyon: I did the promotions on those that were not in, but no demotions
[14:32] <cpaelzer> let me look at it in excuses
[14:32] <cpaelzer> yeah not there
[14:32] <cpaelzer> but here for the docs
[14:32] <cpaelzer> handling that now ...
[14:33] <slyon> thx!
[14:33] <cpaelzer> look at the other cases in that time
[14:33] <slyon> libimobiledivce is new IIRC and is for the desktop team to investigate. didrocks
[14:33] <slyon> dpdk is new IIRC and for the server team to investigate. cpaelzer
[14:34] <didrocks> yeah, itâs new, Iâll pass the message, but be aware that the integration desktop team is for most of them at GUADEC
[14:34] <slyon> the others seem to be handling (having a bug report assigned)
[14:34] <didrocks> so probably wonât be solved by next week. Iâll still ensure itâs logged though
[14:34] <slyon> thanks!
[14:35] <cpaelzer> slyon: cargo-1.76-doc is also in there
[14:35] <cpaelzer> slyon: but missing in the Extra Exclude
[14:35] <cpaelzer> cargo-1.76-doc recommends rust-1.76-doc
[14:35] <slyon> I can add the extra-exclude
[14:35] <cpaelzer> so it will still trigger
[14:35] <cpaelzer> I can demote them now
[14:35] <cpaelzer> thanks for adding the matching exclude
[14:36] <cpaelzer> demotion done
[14:36] <cpaelzer> I can talk about dpdk->isa-support
[14:36] <cpaelzer> That was me doing that in Debian and not thinking that I need a MIR
[14:36] <cpaelzer> That will be super duper trivial
[14:36] <cpaelzer> as it has no content, it is only dependency magic
[14:37] <cpaelzer> I'll do the paperwork but then will reach out for someone to do a review
[14:37] <cpaelzer> anyone willing to sign up to be pinged by me on that?
[14:37] <slyon> I'll be travelling for the next 2 weeks. So I'm probably not the best choice :)
[14:38] <cpaelzer> Well, it isn't urgent - worst case it will be here next week as bug that needs an owner
[14:38] <cpaelzer> while saying next week - I'll be on the mid cycle sprint then
[14:39] <slyon> I'll be at DebConf
[14:39] <cpaelzer> yep
[14:39] <cpaelzer> anyone else mentally getting ready to lead this next week?
[14:39] <cpaelzer> we can anser this in AOB
[14:39] <cpaelzer> going on for now
[14:39] <slyon> so MIR meeting attendance might be low
[14:39] <cpaelzer> s/anser/answer/
[14:39] <cpaelzer> it surely will be
[14:40] <sarnold> good morning
[14:40] <cpaelzer> I might just ping all of you for a reivew directly then
[14:40] <cpaelzer> and we have a light or skipped meeting
[14:40] <cpaelzer> let us see who is available then
[14:40] <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs

[14:41] <cpaelzer> There is a barrage on 18th of July
[14:41] <cpaelzer> all around the openstack driven MIRs
[14:41] <sarnold> alas, not much happy news to report here
[14:41] <cpaelzer> that is ok, they will mark it for us once ready
[14:41] <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements
[14:41] <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues
[14:41] <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls
[14:41] <sarnold> ah sorry I jumped the gun :) I saw long urls, heh
[14:41] <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues
[14:41] <cpaelzer> np sarnold
[14:41] <cpaelzer> nothing here either
[14:41] <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue
[14:41] <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?
[14:41] <cpaelzer> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

[14:41] <cpaelzer> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect

[14:42] <cpaelzer> #link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594
[14:42] <cpaelzer> sarnold: you say nothing to report, but last time you said there will be more talks on getting resources here
[14:42] <cpaelzer> and since then the backlog increased a bit
[14:42] <cpaelzer> once these python things we just saw in incomplete hit (5 IIRC) they will go there too
[14:42] <sarnold> zounds
[14:42] <cpaelzer> heh
[14:42] <slyon> this is new for security (as of today): https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/highway/+bug/2070807
[14:42] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2070807 in highway (Ubuntu) "[MIR] highway" [Undecided, New]
[14:43] <cpaelzer> needs to be added to Jira
[14:43] <cpaelzer> sarnold: please map that to Jira
[14:43] <sarnold> https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/SEC-4768
[14:43] <cpaelzer> sarnold: give me either a) some hope this will work out b) a call that I should escalate things
[14:44] <cpaelzer> sarnold: in the past you said discussions go on and I'm more than happy to leave this to you. Unless IF you want me to push for it as well
[14:45] <sarnold> cpaelzer: well, the most recent conversation I had with aburrage, he was of the opinion that it would be easier / less scary / more welcoming to onboard the completely new folks if I work on my almost-roadmap-items of making easier onboarding tools and documentation improvements
[14:45] <cpaelzer> sarnold: ok I guess, I count this as hope then
[14:45] <sarnold> cpaelzer: so perhaps it's on me to try to improve the early onboarding experiences
[14:46] <cpaelzer> ok
[14:46] <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?
[14:46] <cpaelzer> I double checked, I can lead next week at 25% brain power
[14:46] <cpaelzer> since we expect low attendence thta might be ok
[14:46] <didrocks> nothing for me, but ditto for next week, can attend with parallel meetings
[14:46] <cpaelzer> the other 75% go to plenary sessions
[14:46] <cpaelzer> nothing else from me
[14:47] <sarnold> nothing here
[14:47] <slyon> I probably cannot attend next week (and the week after)
[14:47] <slyon> nothing else from me
[14:47] <joalif> nothing here
[14:47] <cpaelzer> similar story for all debconf/demcamp/virtual-sprint folks
[14:47] <cpaelzer> thank you all
[14:47] <didrocks> thank you!
