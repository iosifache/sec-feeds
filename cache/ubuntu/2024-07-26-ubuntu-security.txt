[04:17] <Juest> umm, can canonical remove unwanted keys from the ubuntu hkp server?
[04:19] <sudhackar> Hello Juest, do you maintain the hkp server?
[04:21] <Juest> sudhackar: i am just a user asking about the server
[04:21] <Juest> interesting, was that a highlight word for the right people?
[04:21] <sudhackar> sorry I was just trying to understand the rationale behind the demand
[04:22] <Juest> sudhackar: to answer your question, no, but i am just wondering about whatever exceptions are done with possible high risk cases of compromised keys
[04:22] <Juest> well i know its just public keys but yeah
[04:22] <Juest> is it not possible to accidentally upload private keys, correct?
[04:23] <Juest> excuse my stupidity, i should know this, i was just asking to double check something of my own
[04:24] <sudhackar> its a hockeypuck server - You can always read their doc
[04:24] <Juest> can others sync with the hkp server? i am not saying its happening right now but im wondering if its possible to have a malicious scenario where syncing would cause a wipe
[04:32] <sudhackar> I think its valid to treat it with such threat model but both hockeypuck and `gpg --keyserver .... --send-keys ....` can be checked
[04:40] <Juest> :)
[04:41] <Juest> was it thought before?
[04:42] <Juest> sudhackar: so they already have checks to prevent such case?
[09:15] <rbasak> Juest: I'm not an expert on gpg keys and keyserver, but my understanding is that if there's a compromised key then the private key holder can issue a revocation, and that is then carried by keyservers. So keys are never deleted as such. On the Launchpad end, users list their keys, so to get Launchpad to stop treating a key as valid, the user can remove it. I don't know if Launchpad pays attention 
[09:15] <rbasak> to key revocations or not (I'd hope it does!)

[17:54] <Juest> rbasak: ah right, thanks for your input :) i mean, what if someone is trying to erase their existence either because of their changed threat model or being a high risk person that is harassed
[19:02] <JanC> if you have such a problem and if you can't remove your own keys using the protocol you can always contact Canonical directly under GDPR rules
