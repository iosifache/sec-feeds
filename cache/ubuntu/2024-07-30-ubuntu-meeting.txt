[14:29] <jbicha> o/
[14:31] <didrocks> hey o/
[14:32] <didrocks> I think people are either at events or busy with meetings, letâs get cracking a small and everyone can read the scrollback as suited
[14:32] <didrocks> #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status
[14:32] <meetingology> Meeting started at 14:32:33 UTC.  The chair is didrocks.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology
[14:32] <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick
[14:32] <sarnold> good morning
[14:32] <didrocks> Ping for MIR meeting - didrocks joalif slyon sarnold cpaelzer jamespage ( eslerm dviererbe )
[14:32] <didrocks> #topic current component mismatches
[14:32] <didrocks> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

[14:32] <didrocks> #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches.svg
[14:33] <didrocks> it seems the only untracked one is dkms -> gcc-13. I donât think we are going to miss it before release :)
[14:34] <didrocks> up to foundation, but with the holidays we donât have representative, doko: this is probably on you and it seems just some AA work for gcc promotion (dkms -> gcc-13)
[14:34] <didrocks> #topic New MIRs
[14:34] <didrocks> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing
[14:34] <didrocks> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir
[14:35] <didrocks> Iâm moving back libdisplayinfo to NEW and reassigned to slyon once he is back
[14:36] <didrocks> and so, we have 3 of them being NEW
[14:36] <didrocks> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libimobiledevice-glue/+bug/2074086
[14:36] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2074086 in libimobiledevice-glue (Ubuntu) "MIR libimobiledevice-glue" [Undecided, New]
[14:37] <didrocks> I am happy to take it, that will be one less on the list
[14:37] <didrocks> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-x13s-settings/+bug/2074078
[14:37] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2074078 in ubuntu-x13s-settings (Ubuntu) "[MIR] ubuntu-x13s-settings" [Undecided, New]
[14:38] <didrocks> it seems an easy one. As I think everyone else is away, but Iâm going to assume cpaelzer is happy to take this simple configuration package from the description :)
[14:39] <sarnold> :)
[14:39] <didrocks> otherwise, I will blame the MIR description report :p
[14:39] <didrocks> last one is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/isa-support/+bug/2073895
[14:39] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2073895 in isa-support (Ubuntu) "[MIR] isa-support" [Undecided, New]
[14:40] <didrocks> unsure if the "TBD - create the MIR request" is actually cpaelzer not updating the comment to the description
[14:40] <didrocks> apart from the TBDSRC, the rest seems like a ready MIR
[14:40] <sarnold> mostly, there's still a 'TBDSRC' in there, heh
[14:40] <cpaelzer> thanks for running this didrocks
[14:41] <cpaelzer> I'm partially here now
[14:41] <cpaelzer> reading backlog
[14:41] <didrocks> cpaelzer: yw! I did a partial MIR assignement to you ;)
[14:41] <sarnold> '  x86-64 architecture, corresponding to x86-65 psABI v1." from the package description
[14:42] <cpaelzer> I'm happy to take the one you wanted to pass me
[14:42] <sarnold> "we've got 64 bits at home, why do you need 65 bits?"
[14:42] <didrocks> cpaelzer: already done!
[14:42] <cpaelzer> is that https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-x13s-settings/+bug/2074078 - yeah I see
[14:42] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2074078 in ubuntu-x13s-settings (Ubuntu) "[MIR] ubuntu-x13s-settings" [Undecided, New]
[14:42] <cpaelzer> will you be able to take https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/isa-support/+bug/2073895 as a trade?
[14:42] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2073895 in isa-support (Ubuntu) "[MIR] isa-support" [Undecided, New]
[14:42] <didrocks> and so, on isa-support, letâs see next week if we can volounteer any victim to review it
[14:42] <didrocks> cpaelzer: I did take libimobiledevice-glue as the one for this week
[14:43] <cpaelzer> arrr
[14:43] <didrocks> depending on the bribing, I can trade! :)
[14:43] <cpaelzer> fine, 1 sec
[14:43] <cpaelzer> we nkow slyon is on debconf
[14:43] <didrocks> yep
[14:43] <cpaelzer> But joalif: jamespage: if you read this later and you have a bit of time, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/isa-support/+bug/2073895 should be really trivial
[14:43] <cpaelzer> if it would not violate rules I'm tempted to self-approve :-)
[14:44] <cpaelzer> but there are reasons we have more than one set of eyes - maybe my assumptions are not right
[14:44] <didrocks> cpaelzer: more seriously if isa-support is urgent, Iâm happy to take it instead of the other one which I think can wait for another week
[14:44] <cpaelzer> It is not more urgent than others
[14:44] <cpaelzer> it is more the (hopeful) triviality which makes me wonder if it should wait
[14:44] <cpaelzer> So I wanted to raise it with joalif and jamespage in case they see the ping later
[14:45] <jamespage> I've seen your ping
[14:45] <cpaelzer> didrocks: please feel free to go on here
[14:45] <cpaelzer> I wanted to ask, but not force anyone as of now.
[14:45] <didrocks> I just apt sourced it
[14:45] <didrocks> indeed, itâs easy
[14:45] <didrocks> Iâm taking it too to unblock you
[14:45] <cpaelzer> thank you
[14:46] <didrocks> ok, letâs move on
[14:46] <didrocks> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions
[14:46] <cpaelzer> ack
[14:46] <didrocks> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams
[14:46] <didrocks> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir
[14:47] <didrocks> ok, it seems jamespage spammed us :)
[14:47] <didrocks> to clear the proposed-migration map!
[14:47] <cpaelzer> hehe
[14:47] <cpaelzer> that is fine
[14:48] <didrocks> the rest looks ok to me and there is nothing pending on us as far as I can see
[14:48] <cpaelzer> they also seem to be quick cases once openstack is convinced they are ready (=> New state) I do not expect much surprises
[14:48] <cpaelzer> ack
[14:48] <didrocks> correct, it seems that it wonât be the final rush on that side at least before FF
[14:48] <didrocks> #topic Process/Documentation improvements
[14:48] <didrocks> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues
[14:49] <didrocks> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls
[14:49] <didrocks> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues
[14:49] <didrocks> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/61 is a valid question
[14:49] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Issue 61 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "The package does deal with exotic hardware, it is present at TBD" [Open]
[14:50] <cpaelzer> indeed
[14:50] <cpaelzer> let us just sync that we both would agree, brainstorm examples here
[14:50] <cpaelzer> if we do roughly agree, I can create a PR at some calm moment
[14:50] <cpaelzer> I can think of
[14:50] <cpaelzer> 1. Ubuntu compute center at location X
[14:51] <sarnold> "present in testflinger", "present in the taipei testing lab, talk with $name on $team, manager $name"
[14:51] <cpaelzer> 2. can be accessed at cloud provider foo via machine type bar
[14:51] <cpaelzer> ack to your list sarnold
[14:51] <didrocks> I think the confusion could be also that the "it" may refer to the package
[14:51] <sarnold> "engineering sample in $name's home on $team, manager $name"
[14:51] <didrocks> instead of the hardware
[14:51] <sarnold> good point
[14:52] <cpaelzer> indeed
[14:52] <cpaelzer> we can fix this in one go
[14:52] <cpaelzer> thank you both, let me make a PR once I find 10 minutes with that as the start
[14:52] <didrocks> but I agree too with the examples, that would be good illustrations and shows what the "it" refers too (probably 2 sentences)
[14:52] <didrocks> thanks cpaelzer!
[14:52] <cpaelzer> BTW I'm not too happy at the "home HW" maybe i should order them by "ok'ness' :-)
[14:53] <didrocks> heh :-)
[14:53] <sarnold> good idea
[14:53] <didrocks> another fun topic, security!
[14:53] <sarnold> "it is present on amazon"  :)
[14:53] <didrocks> ahah, with this referral code ofc :p
[14:53] <sarnold> lol
[14:53] <cpaelzer> lol

[14:54] <didrocks> - ensure your teams items are prioritized among each other as you'd expect
[14:54] <sarnold> alas no progress here :( it's been a very busy week so I've not pushed further on our resourcing issues :(
[14:54] <didrocks> - ensure community requests do not get stomped by teams calling for favors too much

[14:54] <didrocks> (sorry, it seems my weechat client is really lagging in multi-lines)
[14:54] <sarnold> weechat is trying to keep you from being kicked off -- it might be a bit overzealous about it, but its heart is in the right place. there might be a setting for that :)
[14:55] <didrocks> sarnold: ack, I know the feeling here too :( as cpaelzer said, as long as itâs known by the chain management, this is what we can do
[14:55] <didrocks> sarnold: yeah, I will not blame it after more than 14 years of good services since I moved from irssi :p
[14:55] <sarnold> didrocks: certainly aburrage knows
[14:55] <sarnold> wow
[14:55] <sarnold> weechat still feels like a very new thing to me
[14:56] <didrocks> pitti sold me to it! (moved from bip + irssi to weechat)
[14:56] <didrocks> #topic Any other business?
[14:56] <sarnold> none here
[14:56] <didrocks> nothing for me either
[14:56] <cpaelzer> thank you didrocks for driving this while all are at the virtual sprint!
[14:56] <cpaelzer> nothing else from server
[14:57] <didrocks> cpaelzer: no pb! However, you wonât have any special not so random number suite today :p
[14:57] <didrocks> so, going classicâ¦

[14:57] <sarnold> thanks didrocks, all :)
[14:57] <cpaelzer> yeah, thank you all!
[14:57] <didrocks> see you next week, thanks all! :)
[15:01] <sarnold> didrocks:  irc.server_default.anti_flood https://weechat.org/files/doc/weechat/stable/weechat_user.en.html#weechat_options  -- the default is 2000 ms, which feels like an eternity. probably 500ms would be safe enough.
[15:03] <didrocks> sarnold: thanks for looking! :)
[15:20] <joalif> cpaelzer: re https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/isa-support/+bug/2073895 i'm going on PTO next week for  2 weeks, and I don't have cycles to do it this week :/
[15:20] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2073895 in isa-support (Ubuntu) "[MIR] isa-support" [Undecided, New]
[17:03] <cpaelzer> no problem joalif, didrocks already picked it by now. Enjoy your time off !
