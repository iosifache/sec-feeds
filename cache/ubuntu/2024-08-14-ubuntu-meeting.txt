[11:40] <Skia> Question to the DMB: would an application like this (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/skia/MembershipApplication) be accepted? It just redirects to a Discourse application because I first applied to Ubuntu Member before "upgrading" to Ubuntu Contributing Developer upon suggestion by p_aride. Do I really need to convert the application to a Wiki page?

[13:11] <rbasak> Skia: IMHO that's fine
[13:14] <jbicha> yeah, people have had issues editing the Ubuntu wiki anyway so using discourse is good
[13:20] <slyon> jbicha: Yes, the sysprof MIR looks ready. Now you need to chase an AA to get it promoted: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sysprof/+bug/2066269/comments/7
