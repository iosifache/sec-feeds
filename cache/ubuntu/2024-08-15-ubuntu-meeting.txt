[15:08] <bdmurray> Hmm, I don't think I've seen this wiki page on mirrors
[15:10] <bdmurray> dbungert: shouldn't you have use â4 minutes ?
[15:11] <bdmurray> Or â ?
[15:11] <dbungert> your unicode skills exceed my own
[15:13] <juliank> #topic Release incoming bugs

[15:14] <juliank> bug 2075183 is in universe but of high interest to Ubuntu QA I suppose
[15:14] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2075183 in python-amqplib (Ubuntu) "Produced binary package for Oracular is Python2 only" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2075183
[15:15] <juliank> I'd like to argue Skia found it so Skia can fix it
[15:16] <bdmurray> ð
[15:16] <juliank> Heh
[15:16] <waveform> oh dear, his unicode skills include emojis...
[15:16] <juliank> I think it might get lost
[15:16] <juliank> if unassigned
[15:16] <juliank> But oh well
[15:17] <juliank> Tagged
[15:17] <juliank> All other incoming lists are empty
[15:17] <bdmurray> It was reported upstream so maybe ...
[15:17] <juliank> Including the unknown ones not having anything for us
[15:17] <juliank> #topic Team proposed-migration report
[15:17] <juliank> #link https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs
[15:18] <juliank> glibc blocking linux-meta remains with schopin
[15:19] <juliank> systemd blocking linux-meta: enr0n
[15:19] <juliank> (Yes I know this might be a linux bug but investigation)
[15:20] <juliank> initramfs-tools blocking  iproute2: vpa1977
[15:21] <juliank> systemd blocking iproute2: pushkarnk
[15:21] <juliank> No wait
[15:21] <juliank> I guess consult with enr0n
[15:22] <juliank> libxs-parse-keyword-perl remains with waveform
[15:22] <juliank> libheif remains with chriscoulson
[15:23] <juliank> glibc: schopin for the time being
[15:23] <juliank> man-db vs apparmor: vorlon
[15:24] <juliank> man-db vs linuxptp/4.2-1ubuntu1: uralt
[15:26] <juliank> sorry
[15:26] <juliank> man-dbg vs dgit/11.10: uralt
[15:26] <juliank> man-db vs firejail: dbungert
[15:26] <dbungert> ack
[15:26] <juliank> man-db vs lintian: liushuyu
[15:28] <juliank> man-db vs streamlink: mateus-morais
[15:28] <mateus-morais> ack
[15:29] <juliank> germinate: juliank
[15:30] <juliank> apt blocking valgrind: juliank
[15:30] <juliank> this passes but needs a retry for race condition
[15:30] <juliank> oh that's with ginggs
[15:32] <juliank> boost1.83 blocking python3-defaults: rkratky
[15:33] <juliank> python3-defaults vs sphinx/7.4.7-2: danilogondolfo
[15:33] <danilogondolfo> ack
[15:33] <juliank> python3-defaults vs wesnoth-1.18/1:1.18.2-1: ravikant_
[15:33] <ravikant_> juliank: ack
[15:34] <juliank> boost1.83 blocking {bzip2,icu} seem the same boost failure
[15:34] <rkratky> juliank: ack
[15:35] <juliank> rkratky: So I think all the boost1.83 tests just need retrying, so you can just collect all the triggers as retry-autopkgtest-regressions tends to do, and retry them all
[15:36] <juliank> there is a newer boost that migrated
[15:38] <juliank> dbus vs wesnoth  upils (potentially same as ravikant_'s issue)
[15:38] <juliank> icu vs  mysql-8.0/8.0.39-1  paride
[15:39] <juliank> dbus vs wesnoth: bdmurray
[15:39] <juliank> sorry
[15:39] <juliank> dbus vs wesnoth: bdrung
[15:39] <dbungert> juliank: if you want to give me one more, ginggs already ran the man-db vs firejail retest and it passed
[15:39] <rkratky> juliank: thanks
[15:40] <juliank> dbungert: Pick yourself from the grey list :)
[15:40] <juliank> #topic AOB
[15:40] <bdmurray> It finished during the meeting? \o/
[15:41] <dbungert> it did finish during the meeting
[15:41] <waveform> I'll be out next week
