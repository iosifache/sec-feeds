[16:00] <fheimes> hello \o
[16:01] <teward> o/
[16:02] <teward> genii: we need a pot of coffee in here!
[16:10] <rbasak> fheimes: sorry it seems that other DMB members are absent. Could you reschedule, please?
[16:10] <fheimes> yeah, heard that schopin can't make it today
[16:11] <fheimes> okay, I'll pencil in for the next DMB Monday's meeting
[16:11] <fheimes> shall I also send another note to the ML ?
[16:11] <rbasak> It's not necessary but still useful to send a note to the ML I guess
[16:12] <fheimes> ok, will do
[16:12] <fheimes> but there is someone else already for 2024-09-02
[16:13] <fheimes> still targetting 2024-09-02 ? (since I believe the plan is to have only one application per meeting, right?)
[16:14] <fheimes> (would be two PPU applications then on 2024-09-02)
[16:16] <utkarsh2102> hey, are we having a meeting?
[16:18] <teward> utkarsh2102: looks like it was already rescheduled.
[16:18] <fheimes> @utkarsh2102 rbasak just asked me to reschedule (due to absence of members) - so probably not
[16:18] <teward> there's rbasak, you, and me right now utkarsh there's not enough for quorum
[16:18] <teward> utkarsh2102: ^^
[16:19] <teward> utkarsh2102: so fheimes was asked to reschedule by rbasak
[16:19] <utkarsh2102> gotcha, thank you for letting me know!
[16:19] <utkarsh2102> oh no :(
[16:21] <utkarsh2102> okay, I'll drop in that case
[16:21] <utkarsh2102> have a good{day,evening,night}, y'all o/
