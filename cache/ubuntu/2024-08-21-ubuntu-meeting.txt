[12:00] <mapreri> hello!
[12:02] <nteodosio> Hi, we should have a meeting now, right?
[12:03] <mapreri> yep, figuring out if we have a quorum :)
[12:03] <Kilos> hi nteodosio
[12:09] <Bashing-om> nteodosio: Waiting to get quorum :( Oh seven hundred here is the west.
[12:13] <mapreri> nteodosio: while we figure out if we'll reach a quorum or will have to give up on today's meeting, I wanted to point out to you that your application is kind of weak: no endorsements at all (you have just one in the PPU application, and limited in scope), and overall I don't perceive a clear interest in ubuntu's community.
[12:14] <nteodosio> mapreri, I see, what is PPU?
[12:14] <mapreri> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/nteodosio/contributing-developer-application mhhh "contributing developer".  I now realize it's not a PPU
[12:15] <mapreri> what's a "contributing developer" ?  PPU stands for per-package upload, it's a limited set of upload rights to the ubuntu archive.
[12:16] <mapreri> TIL https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-developer-members
[12:16] <nteodosio> Which is different from Ubuntu Membership, correct?
[12:17] <mapreri> did they rename the "Ubuntu Developers" team into "Ubuntu Contributing Developers" ?  pretty sure that team was just called "Ubuntu Developers".  I also didn't know one could join that LP team directly
[12:18] <nteodosio> I think there may have been some renaming as per the follow up in my Discourse application post.
[12:19] <Kilos> nteodosio  and remember in any membership application , the more endorsements you have the stronger are your chances
[12:19] <mapreri> nteodosio: yes.  The Ubuntu Membership is this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership - something that is in a way much broader, and really not specific to any development contribution.
[12:19] <mapreri> https://launchpad.net/~ubuntumembers
[12:19] <Kilos> Do you have and supporters here?
[12:20] <nteodosio> There is only one endorsement in the Wiki page, seb128, who is not in this particular channel right now.
[12:21] <mapreri> nteodosio: personally (which might be different than others in the membership board), I consider the fact that one person should clearly feel "part of ubuntu" and have a view of "what can I do to make ubuntu, and its community, better and better", and I like to perceive this as part of the application :)
[12:21] <mapreri> nteodosio: right, but that's for the contributing developer thing, not for the "ubuntu membership" part.
[12:22] <mapreri> although several teams (MOTU at least, not sure about the ~ubuntu-developer-members) also inherit all the parts of ~ubuntumembers too
[12:23] <nteodosio> Thanks for the feedback, I'll keep that in mind for the next meeting â if today we're not getting quorum that is.
[12:23] <mapreri> alright, yes ~ubuntu-developer-members is a subteam of ~ubuntumembers
[12:24] <nteodosio> The requirements are these though: https://ubuntu.com/community/membership/requirements
[12:26] <mapreri> yep
[12:27] <nteodosio> If ubuntu-developer-member (udm) is a sub-team of ubuntumembers (um), then is it right to assume I don't have to ask someone who endorsed the udm to rewrite his endorsement to um?
[12:28] <mapreri> rather, you should apply directly to them (to the DMB) rather than with us
[12:29] <mapreri> I suppose here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers#Ubuntu_Contributing_Developers
[12:29] <mapreri> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/ApplicationProcess
[12:29] <nteodosio> By which you mean I should apply to Contributor Developer rather than Ubuntu Member?
[12:30] <fenris> ello .. apologies for the late joining the meeting
[12:30] <mapreri> nteodosio: I mean, you did write https://wiki.ubuntu.com/nteodosio/contributing-developer-application which is for contributing developer?
[12:31] <mapreri> I'mâ¦ also confused :3
[12:31] <nteodosio> Yeah let's recapitulate :). if I go to https://ubuntu.com/community/membership/requirements and I believe I match the requirements, I to follow the "ready to apply" at the bottom of it, which tells me to create the discourse post, which is https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/nathan-teodosio-membership-application/46796, and then be at one meeting in #ubuntu-meeting.
[12:32] <mapreri> right
[12:32] <nteodosio> So here I am. :D
[12:32] <mapreri> cool
[12:34] <mapreri> incidentally, we did reach a quorum with fenris joining, so we could go ahead with this nowâ¦
[12:34] <Kilos> I would accept him. the probs come in with canonical guys, they dont understand the whole ubuntu thing
[12:35] <mapreri> btw, to recapitulate a bit more: there are two membership: this one and the developer one.  the developer one implies this "wider" one.  the developer one is taken care of by a different team at different meeting.
[12:41] <mapreri> the person I believe would chair for us says they are too sleepy to do so :3
[12:41] <mapreri> nteodosio: so let's get this meeting formally in place if you agree!
[12:41] <mapreri> (unless you don't want to anymore)
[12:41] <nteodosio> mapreri, sure let's go!
[12:42] <mapreri> #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board
[12:42] <meetingology> Meeting started at 12:42:43 UTC.  The chair is mapreri.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology
[12:42] <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

[12:42] <meetingology> Current voters: Bashing-om, Kilos, fenris, mapreri
[12:43] <mapreri> Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for <DATE>. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards
[12:43] <mapreri> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.
[12:43] <mapreri> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).
[12:43] <mapreri> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.
[12:43] <mapreri> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.
[12:43] <mapreri> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)
[12:43] <mapreri> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...
[12:43] <mapreri> #topic Nathan Teodosio  @nteodosio
[12:44] <mapreri> #link https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/nathan-teodosio-membership-application/46796
[12:44] <mapreri> nteodosio: feel free to give a short introduction of yourself
[12:45] <nteodosio> I'm at the desktop team for little more than two years, mainly maintaining Chromium but also participating on maintaince of the desktop snaps and deb desktop packages.
[12:47] <fenris> a part of contributing to the project codes, merging request , assigned bugs .. can we know what other contributions you has involve or participate?
[12:48] <nteodosio> Hmm you mean apart from contributing to maintenance work?
[12:48] <fenris> yeah
[12:49] <nteodosio> Nothing comes to mind, can you give me one example of what would fit your question? Documentation?
[12:50] <Bashing-om> nteodosio: Put another way: As an Canonical employee - what does acquiring Ubuntu Membership mean to you ?
[12:52] <nteodosio> Bashing-om, to me it means I'm a trusted member of the chain. That means that, e.g., if I were to leave Canonical I would still be a part of Ubuntu
[12:52] <nteodosio> Which also implies that my contributions to Ubuntu are not tied to that.
[12:53] <Bashing-om> nteodosio: Good point - thanks.
[12:53] <nteodosio> You are welcome.
[12:54] <mapreri> what are you thoughts about more ubuntu promotion amongst the masses?  You are part of the desktop team, so I suppose you want more "normal" users to use ubuntu (i.e., not necessarily developers or servers, etc).
[12:55] <nteodosio> Yes indeed, that's why I think it is important to keep supporting the GUI stuff even if they are "easy" CLI counterparts. I know that the latter is a bit scary, I remember when I was in that position too.
[12:56] <nteodosio> So for example I really like contributing to software-properties and update-manager even if they can be replaced by say editing /etc/apt/sources.list{,d/} or apt update; apt upgrade.
[12:57] <nteodosio> I'm not the one doing the promotion in the sense of "spreading it" outside of my personal circle but I belive that by keeping software good and intuitive that comes naturally.
[12:57] <mapreri> any interest in helping out your local community (if there is one)?
[12:57] <nteodosio> You mean geografically local?
[12:58] <fenris> i was about to ask the same
[12:58] <Kilos> ubuntu has loco teams all over,
[12:58] <fenris> are you joining any Ubuntu project group especially your LoCo?
[12:58] <mapreri> https://ubuntu.com/community/locos
[12:59] <Bashing-om> nteodosio: In some event that you and Canonical have a parting of ways - what means are at your disposal to continue Ubuntu contributions ?
[12:59] <nteodosio> I am not member of any such group until now, giving a quick look at it I would be happy to join. So far I normally hang around in #ubuntu and try to help when I can.
[13:00] <nteodosio> Bashing-om, as I don't have upload rights to any package, parting with Canonical would not alter my way of contributing, namely debdiff sponsoring or merge requests.
[13:00] <mapreri> alright
[13:00] <nteodosio> Only with regards to Chromium we'd need to adjust access I think.
[13:01] <mapreri> Let's call for votes!
[13:01] <nteodosio> As right now I have direct write access to it (I didn't have for the Bionic deb of course).
[13:01] <nteodosio> Ack.
[13:01] <mapreri> #vote Ubuntu Membership for nteodosio
[13:01] <meetingology> Please vote on: Ubuntu Membership for nteodosio
[13:01] <meetingology> Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')
[13:01] <Bashing-om> +1

[13:02] <Kilos> +1
[13:02] <meetingology> +1 received from Kilos
[13:03] <mapreri> mh
[13:05] <mapreri> 0 - you have clearly contributed for quite a while, and my perception is that you might indeed want to approach "the community side" a bit more.  0 mostly because it feels you are a bit lost on what the community actually is, but not -1 as you do have plenty of (code) contributions -taking the time to also send them to debian, etc.

[13:05] <mapreri> well, this is it!
[13:06] <mapreri> Congratulations to all the new members. Don't forget to check the perks at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership#The_Perks and once you've been added to the members group remember to apply for your certificate at https://forms.canonical.com/certificate/ (1/2)
[13:06] <mapreri> Your @ubuntu.com email address will go live within 48 hours. Do NOT set it as your primary launchpad.net email address because that will cause emails to loop forever and you'll never receive them! (2/2)
[13:06] <mapreri> Bashing-om: could I leave the post-meeting stuff (including adding him to the LP team) to you?
[13:06] <Kilos> nteodosio  congrats , welcome aboard
[13:06] <nteodosio> Thank you all!
[13:07] <seb128> nteodosio, congrats! :-)
[13:07] <nteodosio> Thanks seb128! (:
[13:07] <mapreri> nteodosio: congrants indeed!  As somebody told me in the past: the membership is a form of recognition and a bit of a starting point.  You are a recognized contributor, in a way that ought to be more reason to keep contributing! :)
[13:08] <nteodosio> Thank you mapreri, and also for the hint on the Loco teams!
