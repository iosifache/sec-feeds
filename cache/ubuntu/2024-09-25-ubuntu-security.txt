[12:57] <ahasenack> hi #security, is there a preferred way to declare profile transitions, I have this in an MP I'm reviewing:
[12:57] <ahasenack> +  /usr/sbin/chronyd Px,
[12:57] <ahasenack> the alternative would be
[12:57] <ahasenack>  /usr/sbin/chronyd Px -> chrony,
[12:57] <ahasenack> for example
[12:57] <ahasenack> (the crony profile declares both the path and the name)
[12:57] <ahasenack> oh, wait, my mistake, it only declares the path
[12:58] <ahasenack>  /usr/sbin/chronyd flags=(attach_disconnected) {
[12:58] <ahasenack> ...
[12:58] <ahasenack> }
[12:58] <ahasenack> so I guess /usr/sbin/chronyd Px -> /usr/sbin/chronyd, would look silly
[15:44] <leosilva> georgiag: ^ any idea? 
[21:53] <teward> mdeslaur: did the security tracker get updated for CVEs so it **no longer accepts Package specific searches**?
[21:53] <teward> on ubuntu.com/security i mean
[21:54] <teward> because it looks that way so we can no longer easily search for a specific package's CVEs, etc.
[21:55] <teward> at least on the frontend.
[22:02] <teward> also security team the Security API is **incorrect** and defined enums are missing defaults.  This means your openapi json spec or swagger 2.0 spec is wrong.
[22:44] <mdeslaur> teward: hrm, they keep rewriting that...yeah, looks like search by package is gone
[22:45] <mdeslaur> sarnold: do you remember where we can file a bug for that? ^
[22:45] <teward> mdeslaur: the API still has it so i know its doable.  tell whoever is rewriting the frontend to **stop** until they check with you
[22:45] <teward> also i have a partially updated openapi 3.0 spec json to replace the swagger 2.0 json thats there and unsupported now.
[22:45] <mdeslaur> you want me to speak to the web nerds? eww
[22:46] <teward> mdeslaur: if I do it it comes with the stigma that by them breaking it its now a community level problem :P
[22:46] <mdeslaur> :)
[22:47] <teward> just let them know they need to fix it and worst case I rain Hell on IS :P
[22:47] <teward> also i know theres a few API mechanisms that are Dangerous in the documentation for the API, I hope they have some security control in place heh.
[22:48] <teward> maybe i need to talk to these Web Nerds and help them produce an actually usable openapi spec document...  *slapped for suggestion*
[22:49] <teward> mdeslaur: worst case i write a django frontend that uses the API to replicate the searches but ideally Web Team restores what they broke
[22:49] <mdeslaur> there's a bug tracker on github for the website I think, once we get it, you can file all your grievances there :)
[22:50] <teward> heheheh you should warn IS that the demon of an angry sysadmin will be unleashed then xD
[22:51] <mdeslaur> poor github, hoepfully they rate-limit :)
