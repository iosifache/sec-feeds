[18:18] <tomreyn> https://ubuntu.com/security/esm states this on top: "ESM enables continuous vulnerability management for critical, high and medium CVEs." And this further down: "ESM continues security updates [..] for high and critical CVEs [..]"
[18:18] <tomreyn> this sounds like a contradiction regarding medium priority CVEs.

[22:04] <sbeattie> tomreyn: thanks, will pass that along.
[22:07] <tomreyn> thanks, Steve
