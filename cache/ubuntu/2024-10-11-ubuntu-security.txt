[01:31] <mainek00n> I'm reading OVAL and have a question.
[01:31] <mainek00n> When I look at the Ubuntu Security Notice web page, the Source Package is listed in the Update instructions.
[01:31] <mainek00n> However, when I read the USN OVAL, there is no information about the Source Package Name, and the usns in the PKG OVAL lists packages that are not related to that package.
[01:31] <mainek00n> How can I combine OVALs to reproduce the information on the Ubuntu Security Notice web page?
[07:33] <ebarretto> mainek00n: do you have an example ?
