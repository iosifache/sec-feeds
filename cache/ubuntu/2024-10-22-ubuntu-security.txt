[15:18] <ebarretto> mpiano: I sent: for when you are back. I've triggered a manual run to see what's going on
[15:19] <ebarretto> thanks for letting us know, 
[15:21] <mpiano> thanks for looking into it
[15:21] <ebarretto> mpiano: recently we added OSV and OpenVEX to our gamma of data that we produce 
[15:22] <ebarretto> we are still to provide more documentation on that and also working on osv-scanner to get to work with the data
[15:22] <ebarretto> but if you want to explore it, you can find it both in osv.dev as well as in https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-security-notices
[15:22] <ebarretto> both are json based
