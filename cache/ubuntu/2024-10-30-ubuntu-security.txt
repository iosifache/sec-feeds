[09:47] <mpiano> ebarretto: hello, seems like OVAL generation has been stuck again for a few days
[09:51] <ebarretto> mpiano: yep, I'm on it. The USN feed is up-to-date, but CVE and PKG feeds are silently failing
[09:51] <mpiano> ack, thanks for the confirmation
[13:34] <ebarretto> mpiano: the new files are there now, I will keep monitoring what's going on 
[13:35] <mpiano> perfect, thanks again

[18:12] <Odd_Bloke> o/ Hey folks, I know you most likely aren't responsible for this directly, but figured I'd let you know that USN search is returning 500s (so I've filed https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu.com/issues/14454).

[18:49] <oerheks> seems like an CVE, not USN ?
