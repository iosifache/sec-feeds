[15:32] <cpaelzer> jemalloc is now a proper stub
[15:32] <cpaelzer> jpeg-xl still waiting, butthen good
[15:32] <slyon> ouch, sequoia
[15:32] <cpaelzer> the openstack python bits also have proper stubs now
[15:32] <slyon> there's an ongoing discussion about it in Foundations channels
[15:32] <cpaelzer> mysql-8.4 needs a promotion, same source new version
[15:33] <cpaelzer> there was a debian devel post about sequoia
[15:33] <cpaelzer> also too many vowels think about if we added "sequoia in eoan"
[15:34] <cpaelzer> is rust-nettle also related to that slyon?
[15:34] <slyon> most probably yes.
[15:34] <cpaelzer> in there I see libpfm4 hiding for llvm19, but that is a proper bug already
[15:34] <liushuyu> sequoia uses libnettle for crypto operations on non-Windows systems
[15:35] <slyon> Looks like gnupg2 pulls in some sequoia (camelaeon) bits, which depends on all sort of non-vendored rust dependenceis
[15:35] <cpaelzer> ok, we leave that until you have concluded how you want to handle that
[15:36] <cpaelzer> background https://www.mail-archive.com/debian-devel@lists.debian.org/msg382884.html
[15:36] <cpaelzer> for the MIR context we can move on today

[15:36] <cpaelzer> two cases there
[15:36] <liushuyu> The idea was to use the gpgv-compatible command-line tool but with sequoia implementation (since GnuPG now uses an implementation that diverges from the OpenPGP standards)

[15:37] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2087937 in mmdebstrap (Ubuntu) "[MIR] mmdebstrap" [Undecided, New]
[15:38] <slyon> adding a comment..
[15:38] <cpaelzer> this is juliank wanting to revisit - which is fine but not yet putting this to the MIR team discussion
[15:38] <cpaelzer> how about unsubscribing mir-team until this is somewhere we need to look?
[15:38] <liushuyu> Yes, I was about to bring the http-parser vs llhttp discussion, since http-parser was MIR'ed together with Rust toolchain
[15:38] <cpaelzer> we get to that next liushuyu
[15:39] <liushuyu> sorry
[15:39] <cpaelzer> np at all
[15:40] <slyon> for mmdebstrap: Status: Incomplete should be fine until the MIR is filed?
[15:40] <cpaelzer> yep
[15:40] <cpaelzer> I saw your comment
[15:40] <cpaelzer> also removed us until it is ready
[15:40] <cpaelzer> as it might or might not become a MIR again
[15:40] <cpaelzer> let us get to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/node-undici/+bug/2080872 now
[15:40] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2080872 in node-undici (Ubuntu) "libgit2: replace unmaintained http-parser dependency with llhttp" [Undecided, New]
[15:41] <slyon> I think node-undici can be dropped from the MIR list, too.
[15:41] <cpaelzer> liushuyu: so you got the ack by security to use the vendored one
[15:42] <cpaelzer> I do not even see node-undici ?!
[15:42] <slyon> We have the security team agreement. And it's now in the Foundations team's hand to make the switch from (deprecated) http-parser to vendored llhttp
[15:42] <liushuyu> so we had some discussions about the situation and the idea was to use the vendored llhttp
[15:42] <cpaelzer> and it is assigned so schopin
[15:42] <cpaelzer> yes liushuyu
[15:42] <cpaelzer> and security said two things
[15:42] <cpaelzer> 1. yes as it is the best bad option available right now
[15:42] <liushuyu> ... because we can't afford maintaining llhttp by pulling in Node.js
[15:42] <cpaelzer> 2. do something really good so we do not forget revisiting and updating that in the future
[15:43]  * schopin didn't want any part of this but wasn't at that meeting...
[15:43] <cpaelzer> once  llhttp is split apart.
[15:43] <cpaelzer> oO sorry schopin
[15:43] <cpaelzer> mayb liushuyu wants to do that for you?
[15:43] <schopin> you're not the one who assigned it to me ;)
[15:43] <cpaelzer> so you can not be part of it
[15:44] <liushuyu> I don't know if we track vendored dependencies using `Static-Built-Using` binary package tags?
[15:44] <slyon> I think the approach is clear (and has been tested, but rejected for now, in Debian). Vendoring llhttp probably needs a new .orig tarball, though.
[15:45] <cpaelzer> yep, I updated the bug state
[15:45] <cpaelzer> this does not need the MIR team
[15:45] <slyon> ACK, MIR can be dropped
[15:45] <cpaelzer> and you can internally sort out who is allowed to not deal with it

[15:45] <schopin> Well, we did need MIR's ACK on the vendoring but afterwards it's indeed not your problem.
[15:46] <cpaelzer> indeed, but that was given now by the rule slyon quoted and security saying ok as well
[15:46] <cpaelzer> in this list only some openstack dependencies got recent updtes, we've seen them above as stubs
[15:47] <cpaelzer> nothing to act on this one either

[15:47] <cpaelzer> without sarnold around there is not much but staring at the lists
[15:47] <cpaelzer> even a usual suspect like eslerm seems not to be around
[15:47] <cpaelzer> so let me go on for today
[15:47] <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?
[15:48] <liushuyu> oh wait, I would like to ask about https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dbus-broker/+bug/2015538
[15:48] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2015538 in dbus-broker (Ubuntu) "[MIR] dbus-broker" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:48] <cpaelzer> I have a special case raised by utkarsh, but let us discuss the case of liushuyu first
[15:48] <liushuyu> so the situation with dbus-broker is a bit strange, because it's co-owned by both Foundations and Desktop
[15:49] <cpaelzer> yeah, let me answer to that post on the bug
[15:49] <slyon> strictly speaking, it's still in universe, so not owned by anyone. But both teams had some attempts at enabling it in the past..
[15:49] <liushuyu> ... and the trouble is, from the LP bug, I can't see what's blocking the task
[15:50] <slyon> src:dbus is owned by Foundations, so in theory dbus-broker would be a good fit to be owned by Foundations, too.
[15:51] <slyon> liushuyu: the blocker is having dbus and dbus-broker installed in parallel
[15:51] <slyon> gdm needs dbus-run-session (https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gdm/-/blob/main/daemon/gdm-session.c#L2973) which is tightly coupled with src:dbus
[15:51] <liushuyu> slyon: In thoery yes, but you see this kinda breaks GNOME desktop because some components use the legacy `dbus-run-session` thing
[15:51] <slyon> so we either need to adopt gdm, or need a drop-in replacement for dbus-run-session
[15:51] <liushuyu> but we now have several implementations for that
[15:52] <slyon> those implementation need to be packaged, tested & shipped. Then a new case can be made to move the dbus-broker MIR forward. IMO that should be the next step
[15:53] <cpaelzer> yes to the above
[15:53] <cpaelzer> I answered the open questions on the bug
[15:53] <cpaelzer> TL;DR
[15:53] <cpaelzer> 1. I really recommend one team
[15:53] <liushuyu> slyon: I see, then the issue would be there needs to be some communications between Desktop and Foundations to figure out how to perform the transitions
[15:53] <cpaelzer> 2. ubuntu-security is the team to subscribe if it is them
[15:53] <cpaelzer> yes liushuyu
[15:53] <cpaelzer> it seems like neither can do it alone
[15:54] <slyon> yes. liushuyu does that help to clarify the next steps?
[15:54] <cpaelzer> I'm so glad it is late 2024 and not late 2025 being in this state
[15:54] <liushuyu> slyon: Yes
[15:54] <cpaelzer> great
[15:54] <liushuyu> ah, sorry, wrong ping
[15:54] <cpaelzer> then the case i had in mind
[15:55] <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mdevctl/+bug/1889248
[15:55] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 1889248 in libonig (Ubuntu Focal) "[MIR] mdevctl, jq, libonig" [Undecided, New]
[15:55] <cpaelzer> this is about the request to also promote jq in focal (it is in main in >=Jammy)
[15:55] <cpaelzer> I've evaluated the differences and considered it an ack
[15:55] <cpaelzer> security had a look as well, also an ack
[15:56] <slyon> delta should be relatively small, considering we have 1.6 in foca-updates and jammy-release
[15:56] <cpaelzer> as a bonus utkarsh will work on adding autopkgtests of it to devel
[15:56] <cpaelzer> this is a "speak now or forever hold your peace" moment in case you disagree
[15:56] <liushuyu> cpaelzer: I'm so glad it is late 2024 and not late 2025 being in this state > I think you would wish for that, because systemd people might pull out their new Varlink (tm) technology to replace D-Bus
[15:56] <slyon> lgtm
[15:56] <cpaelzer> liushuyu: yeah I've read about that
[15:56] <cpaelzer> jamespage: joalif: any objections?
[15:57] <cpaelzer> and also - any other topic?
[15:57] <cpaelzer> nothing more from me
[15:57] <slyon> nothing here
[15:57] <jamespage> none
[15:58] <liushuyu> No at the moment from me, but I might bring up "Rust code in main" situation
[15:58] <joalif> nothing from me
[15:58] <liushuyu> ... maybe next time?
[15:58] <cpaelzer> from experience that blows the session time, but yeah let us go for it
[15:58] <liushuyu> (considering we are running out of time)
[15:58] <cpaelzer> next time
[15:58] <cpaelzer> 2 minutes will not allow for any progress
[15:58] <slyon> liushuyu: sure! Feel free to join next time, or create an Issue/PR on https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir in the meantime
[15:58] <cpaelzer> please be encouraged to jump in next time
