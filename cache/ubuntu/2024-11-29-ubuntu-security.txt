[15:20] <Aliekezi> Hello, I don't know if this channel is related : I see something that look like apparmor blocking Firefox from accessin /etc/fstab if my interpretation is the good one. Should I worry ? https://bpa.st/NP2Q
[15:46] <ebarretto> georgiag: ^
[15:50] <oerheks> weird reason; Firefox attempts to access / etc / fstab to determine the mounted filesystems and display them in the file chooser dialog.
[15:50] <georgiag> Aliekezi: I don't think you should worry. from the little research I did just know, this is likely triggered by the file chooser dialog
[15:55] <georgiag> you can file a bug for mozilla https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/home since they handle their snap configuration that would allow reading /etc/fstab
[15:58] <oerheks> add yourself to https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/is-it-ok-if-firefox-flooded-log-syslog-with-the-dozens-of-apparmor-denied-messages-every-minute/123804
[15:58] <JanC> Firefox don't have their own file chooser but use Gtk's, right?
[15:58] <oerheks> jups
[15:59] <JanC> it might just be some compatibility thing, having to make it work in many different environments, so they try everything?
