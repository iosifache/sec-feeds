[15:33] <cpaelzer> looks much less expliding than last time
[15:34] <cpaelzer> jpeg-xl, jemalloc, mysql all wait to be acted on
[15:34] <sarnold> good morning
[15:34] <cpaelzer> kernels are usually dealt with by kernel
[15:34] <cpaelzer> the set of openstack related is still a set of stubs
[15:34] <cpaelzer> nothing new here to act, unless some of those cases show up in new/incomplete lists later
[15:34] <cpaelzer> #topic New MIRs
[15:34] <cpaelzer> Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing
[15:35] <cpaelzer> #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&orderby=-date_last_updated&field.status%3Alist=NEW&field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&assignee_option=none&field.assignee=&field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir
[15:35] <cpaelzer> here we go
[15:35] <cpaelzer> mysql-8.4 is likely just same content new versioned source
[15:35] <cpaelzer> I'd handled that as i can also immediately act on promoting it if it is as clear as I expect
[15:36] <cpaelzer> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/jemalloc/+bug/2088056 needs a reviewer
[15:36] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2088056 in jemalloc (Ubuntu) "[MIR] jemalloc" [Undecided, New]
[15:36] <sarnold> is this an ideal moment to ask if we should move to mariadb or stop preferring one over the other?
[15:36] <cpaelzer> sarnold: that discussion has happened on ubuntu-devel
[15:36] <sarnold> mysql isn't exactly what one would call an ideal upstream
[15:36] <sarnold> ah good good
[15:36] <sarnold> I might not get to that discussion until next year, at this rate :/
[15:37] <cpaelzer> now we know your inbox read speed :-)
[15:37] <joalif> i can take jemalloc
[15:37] <cpaelzer> anyone available for jemalloc
[15:37] <cpaelzer> a
[15:37] <cpaelzer> thanks joalif
[15:37] <cpaelzer> and then the third here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnupg2/+bug/2089690
[15:37] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2089690 in rust-sequoia-sq (Ubuntu) "[MIR] rust-sequoia-sq" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:37] <cpaelzer> the explosion of component mismatches reduced, so was that now vendored?
[15:38] <cpaelzer> this isn't really ready for MIR review yet AFAICS
[15:38] <cpaelzer> back to incomplete - WDYT?
[15:38] <slyon> I'm not sure, probably got dropped from gnupg2
[15:38] <cpaelzer> yep
[15:39] <slyon> yeah.. gnupg2 should be assigned to foundations and the others marked as Incomplete
[15:39] <cpaelzer> that is why component mismatches looked sane
[15:39] <cpaelzer> slyon: would that go to foundations-bugs?
[15:40] <slyon> yes, I assigned it, just to make it vanish from the MIR queue
[15:40] <cpaelzer> ok, aborting my update and reloading
[15:40] <cpaelzer> ack
[15:40] <cpaelzer> LGTM
[15:40] <cpaelzer> thanks
[15:40] <cpaelzer> ok, that is this stage for now
[15:40] <cpaelzer> #topic Incomplete bugs / questions
[15:40] <cpaelzer> Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

[15:41] <cpaelzer> I'm happy to see Zixing work on this, bue it would be back to new if it needs a review or anything else
[15:41] <cpaelzer> that is for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dbus-broker/+bug/2015538
[15:41] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2015538 in dbus-broker (Ubuntu) "[MIR] dbus-broker" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:42] <cpaelzer> I'll ask around who drives this over the finishing line and wehn
[15:42] <cpaelzer> but getting the C implementation was one of the former needs IIRC
[15:42] <slyon> thx
[15:42] <cpaelzer> then we have https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nbd/+bug/2054480
[15:43] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2054480 in nbd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] nbd-client" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:43] <cpaelzer> got some tests
[15:43] <cpaelzer> once there also is isolation or a reasonable evidence it was tried and is impossible we can evaluate if all we need was provided
[15:44] <sarnold> there's some code in the tests that unloads an apparmor profile on two architectures
[15:44] <sarnold> feels funny
[15:44] <sarnold> I dropped a comment
[15:44] <cpaelzer> seeing it in line 183
[15:44] <cpaelzer> thanks
[15:44] <cpaelzer> ok then
[15:44] <cpaelzer> going on
[15:44] <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements
[15:44] <cpaelzer> Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues
[15:44] <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls
[15:44] <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues
[15:45] <sarnold> busy
[15:45] <cpaelzer> no new issues
[15:45] <cpaelzer> but two PRs to look at
[15:45] <cpaelzer> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/71
[15:45] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Pull 71 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "Rust: Make the tarball more reproducible" [Open]
[15:45] <cpaelzer> that improves the example
[15:46] <cpaelzer> if we could get a +1 by one of the rust'y people in foundations maybe?
[15:46] <cpaelzer> then this looks like a great help (even though the command got awfully long)
[15:46] <slyon> looks solid
[15:46] <slyon> it's not about Rust, but about tar
[15:46] <dviererbe> I ping Zixing
[15:46] <cpaelzer> thanks dviererbe
[15:46] <cpaelzer> to be clear this is likely 99.999 fine, but having a rusty ack before merge to be sure
[15:47] <slyon> ok
[15:47] <cpaelzer> slyon: isn't it only about the tar as used to repack the vendored dependencies?
[15:47] <cpaelzer> slyon: so it is "rusty tar" :-)
[15:47] <slyon> well, yes
[15:47] <cpaelzer> I mean the options all read well, avoid owner, avoid order, avoid ...
[15:48] <cpaelzer> probably merged next week then
[15:48] <cpaelzer> and thanks juliank for that one!
[15:48] <cpaelzer> next https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/72
[15:48] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Pull 72 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "vendor/Rust: more comprehensive dependency removal" [Open]
[15:48] <juliank> yw
[15:49] <dviererbe> it's marked as a draft, so I think it is not ready yet
[15:49] <cpaelzer> yeah dviererbe
[15:49] <slyon> this is the more rusty part. The "currently unreleased" looks suspicious
[15:49] <cpaelzer> and I also have slight concerns
[15:49] <cpaelzer> I like changing long commandlines to a tool, but being unreleased or only in the very latest limits the use
[15:50] <cpaelzer> I'd suggest to him to write it as "use A, or if available to you B"
[15:51] <cpaelzer> #topic MIR related Security Review Queue
[15:51] <cpaelzer> Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?
[15:51] <cpaelzer> Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

[15:51] <cpaelzer> wb sarnold
[15:51] <sarnold> thanks :)
[15:51] <cpaelzer> jpeg-xl is the one I know holding up things
[15:51] <sarnold> the downside of course is that I have no recollection of the state and wasn't able to find time  yesterday, and I'm unlikely to find time today, either :(
[15:51] <cpaelzer> could that be assigned or did that had reasons it wasn't yet
[15:52] <sarnold> likely just my bandwidth, thanks for identifying a good potential one to assign
[15:52] <cpaelzer> yeah, go for that one if you have limited time
[15:52] <sarnold> thank you thank you :)
[15:52] <cpaelzer> the rest can follow as you are fully recovering the backlog
[15:52] <sarnold> i've only got a few more working days the rest of the year
[15:52] <cpaelzer> the queue is not as bad as it has been, no huge rush atm
[15:52] <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?
[15:53] <cpaelzer> topic: sarnold has too few working days, let me change that ... :-P
[15:53] <sarnold> lol
[15:53] <sarnold> every few years I have my usual conversation "hey what if instead of a year-end carry-over cap we have a monthly PTO cap?"
[15:54] <sarnold> and every few years I'm told it's a good idea for the entire company to shutdown for most of december
[15:54] <sarnold> so :)
[15:54] <cpaelzer> hehe
[15:54] <cpaelzer> collect PTO for early retirement that never happens sarnold :-)
[15:54] <slyon> nothing from my side
[15:54] <cpaelzer> anyway, I assume no true topics we need to discuss then ... ?
[15:55] <sarnold> cpaelzer: oh yeah, those stories of old timers collecting a few years of PTO in their jobs without caps... and then not showing up for their final two years of work :)
[15:55] <sarnold> nothing really here beyond a general note that you should take your holidays and not let your own PTO days expire
[15:55] <cpaelzer> signing that
[15:55]  * sarnold <-- trying to set a good example
[15:55] <cpaelzer> ok, getting ready for the next call then and closing out
[15:55] <cpaelzer> 9
[15:55] <cpaelzer> 3
[15:55] <cpaelzer> 1
[15:55] <cpaelzer> 6
[15:56] <cpaelzer> done
[15:56] <sarnold> thanks cpaelzer, all :)

[15:56] <sarnold> lol yay another fun sequence :)
[15:56] <slyon> thanks cpaelzer, all!
[15:56] <dviererbe> thanks, everyone :)

[20:00] <rbasak> o/
[20:04] <rbasak> vorlon: coming? I don't see seb128 or sil2100 here.
[20:04] <amurray> steve sent a message on MM saying he can't make it a bit earlier so it may be just the two of us
[20:05] <rbasak> We don't have any action items.
[20:05] <rbasak> I'm just quickly checking the other standing items
[20:06] <rbasak> Nothing on the ML, no new bug activity.
[20:06] <rbasak> The next meetings would be on the 17th and the 31st. What's your schedule like for those?
[20:06] <rbasak> I wonder if/what we should skip.
[20:07] <rbasak> How about I write to the ML and ask so others can get to it offline?
[20:07] <amurray> 17th is fine for me but 31st may be tricky
[20:07] <rbasak> Apart from that, I see nothing else for discussion. Shall we skip the meeting today?
[20:07] <amurray> yeah sounds fair - thanks rbasak
