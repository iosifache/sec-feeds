[13:17] <tsimonq2> FYI, I'm also working on updating git in plucky. Not sure if there's pending CVE work but it looks like a semi-frequent flyer.
[13:24] <mdeslaur> tsimonq2: not sure, but thanks for doing it

[18:31] <kmcdebs> I have a question about how seahorse behaves when using the Finding Remote Keys dialog to search keyserver.ubuntu.com, is this the right place for me to ask that?
[18:34] <kmcdebs> When I try to find my key, seahorse never seems to complete the action. Seahorse finds my key, but it remains grayed out, and a progress bar at the bottom of the window never completes. Is this a bug? Or do I have a setting wrong. Performing the same search through the command line seems to work just fine
