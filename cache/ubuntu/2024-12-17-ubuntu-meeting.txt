[15:32] <cpaelzer> normal view is good
[15:32] <cpaelzer> proposed has a bit
[15:32] <cpaelzer> hmm, I didn't pick up sanlock as new
[15:32] <cpaelzer> but it is there
[15:32] <cpaelzer> I'll ask sergio
[15:32] <sarnold> hah, and I missed augeas entirely
[15:33] <sarnold> it's already got an approved MIR?
[15:33] <sarnold> is this *ancient* MIR bug really "the bug"? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/augeas/+bug/434836
[15:33] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 434836 in augeas (Ubuntu Karmic) "[MIR] augeas" [High, Fix Released]
[15:33] <cpaelzer> it was there in the long past
[15:34] <cpaelzer> anyway conside this to be done
[15:34] <sarnold> .. I have to wonder if charms would have been easier if this were part of main
[15:34] <sarnold> but apparently it was, and they weren't? :)
[15:34] <cpaelzer> yep
[15:34] <cpaelzer> abseil -> google test sounds like a memory
[15:35] <cpaelzer> seb128: jbicha: would one of you plesae look afte rabseil?

[15:35] <cpaelzer> all in reviewstages
[15:35] <cpaelzer> and then the set of openstack packages which grind their way to proper cases

[15:37] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2054480 in nbd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] nbd-client" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:38] <sarnold> libgit2 is more than that
[15:38] <cpaelzer> discussions between Pragyansh and sarnold
[15:38] <sarnold> near the very top there's a new merge proposal
[15:38] <cpaelzer> readiny ...
[15:38] <cpaelzer> I ee, asssigned to sponsors
[15:38] <sarnold> I wish the 'flow' of comments could indicate that, I also jumped right past it yesterday when talking it over with eslerm :)
[15:39] <cpaelzer> nice
[15:39] <sarnold> is there anything we need to do to encourage this one along?
[15:39] <cpaelzer> this is what we wanted and discussed as least worse option
[15:39] <cpaelzer> no it will be picked up by patch pilots of foundations sponsors I'd assume
[15:40] <sarnold> cool cool
[15:40] <slyon> well... it's still "on hold", why's that?
[15:40] <cpaelzer> sarnold: your comment on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nbd/+bug/2054480 - do you consider it a hint or a blocking (all arch need to be enabled)
[15:40] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2054480 in nbd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] nbd-client" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:40] <slyon> latest comment was "Currently pending review from the security team"
[15:40] <cpaelzer> I need to read more what the recent comments are about
[15:40] <cpaelzer> seems the apparmor profile
[15:41] <cpaelzer> indeed slyon
[15:41] <cpaelzer> sarnold:  is that review what you've been going over with eslerm?
[15:41] <cpaelzer> should we add a ubuntu-security review slot maybe?
[15:42] <sarnold> cpaelzer: libgit2, eslerm raised it with me, I think he's mostly interested in making sure that goes all the way to completion
[15:42] <slyon> well, sarnold already did the quick approval here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libgit2/+bug/2080872/comments/5
[15:42] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2080872 in libgit2 (Ubuntu) "libgit2: replace unmaintained http-parser dependency with llhttp" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:42] <sarnold> cpaelzer: nbd, I don't think anybody has raised that one
[15:44] <cpaelzer> I like that they work on tests and appamor - I wonder at what point we should call the propose sufficient
[15:44] <cpaelzer> I want to avoid some others rushing through without by saying they tried and can't - and those that spend the effort to be punished by small thing in it
[15:44] <sarnold> ugh I think they went off into the weeds on this one
[15:44] <cpaelzer> to be clear - all I am is unsure
[15:45] <cpaelzer> but I'm tending to want to reward that go for tests and isolation with a positive posture
[15:45] <cpaelzer> so when they come back for review or sponsoring I'd feel +1'ish (plus actually looking at it in depth)
[15:45] <cpaelzer> sarnold:  this feels they tried to explain to you in the last comment
[15:46] <cpaelzer> I'm unsure if more pings there help much, maybe send a DM and discuss this whenever you are both online?
[15:46] <cpaelzer> and then add a comment on the bug with whatever your closing state is afte rthat discussion?
[15:46] <sarnold> cpaelzer: I'll write up a comment
[15:47] <sarnold> "both online" is going to be a Big Challenge, I have a few hours left in the year :)
[15:47] <cpaelzer> slyon: do you know if Pragyansh is in EOY already?
[15:47] <cpaelzer> not sure if you still see the foundations calendar
[15:47] <cpaelzer> sarnold: ok I see why you therefore consider a bug comment
[15:47] <cpaelzer> ok
[15:47] <cpaelzer> let us go on
[15:47] <cpaelzer> #topic Process/Documentation improvements

[15:47] <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls
[15:47] <cpaelzer> #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues
[15:47] <slyon> cpaelzer: sarnold:, no r41k0u still seems to be around
[15:48] <cpaelzer> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/72 is still draft - not touching this one
[15:48] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Pull 72 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "vendor/Rust: more comprehensive dependency removal" [Open]
[15:48] <cpaelzer> https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pull/75 would be ready if you like it slyon and sarnold?
[15:48] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Pull 75 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "Add rules to re-evaluate very old renames" [Open]
[15:49] <cpaelzer> it is what we discussed, allowing for doing a bit more than "auto-yes" when we see renames - AND - the case is super duper old
[15:49] <cpaelzer> and allowing this to be non gating
[15:49] <sarnold> reading
[15:49] <cpaelzer> and furthermore allowing teams to suggest for re-review - which is a nice offering but has to be balanced
[15:49] <cpaelzer> e.g. we recently had a full rewrite in rust - that is worth re-checking and I've done so
[15:50] <cpaelzer> there is no rush, if you both are happy in 3 min - fine. Otherwise leave your comments and I can evolve it until the meeting next year
[15:51] <slyon> +1, lgtm
[15:51] <sarnold> > We'd appreciate if the owning team could file a MIR-reporter bug for it, but would not insist on it if they can't. In that case we create a stub for it.
[15:52] <sarnold> if the goal is to get packages onto our queue, asking for the bug doesn't seem to be too much to ask, right/
[15:52] <sarnold> as a percentage of effort ..
[15:52] <cpaelzer> if they self-ask then it would be no challenge
[15:52] <cpaelzer> but if all that happened is auto sync libfoo3 over libfoo2
[15:52] <cpaelzer> then I thought we can ask, but not insist
[15:53] <sarnold> ahhh, to avoid a potential case of a team needing to do a dozen of them in one cycle?
[15:53] <cpaelzer> yes
[15:53] <slyon> right. Filing a MIR bug takes quite some investigation, and people might not like that. We could still file a stub and do the review/recommendations in there
[15:53] <sarnold> okay, sounds good. baby steps.
[15:53] <cpaelzer> hence all of this is optional - a first step to a better world but acknowledging the shrotages
[15:53] <cpaelzer> also Schrott :-) but actuall shortages
[15:53] <slyon> :)
[15:54] <sarnold> :D (I had to look that one up)
[15:54] <cpaelzer> BTW I also have more ruls to put down out of archive admin work on multivers/restricted - but one at a time
[15:54] <cpaelzer> ok 2x good

[15:55] <cpaelzer> jpeg-xl was on my mind
[15:55] <cpaelzer> it is still in TODO but now has a name
[15:55] <cpaelzer> is that good sarnold?
[15:55] <sarnold> yes, it is good, but likely very little has been done recently :)
[15:55] <jbicha> I just uploaded a jpeg-xl security fix to plucky today ð
[15:55] <cpaelzer> hope for increased progress in january?
[15:56] <sarnold> also, our poor coverity server seems unhappy after repatriating :( we're looking into charming it up to deploy into one of the prodstacks now that we have decent vm capacity
[15:56] <sarnold> I also hope so, I'll certainly be a bit pointier in asking for status updates post-holidays :) -- december is not a month for getting things done :/
[15:56] <cpaelzer> ok, so TL;DR many reasons, the queue is not moving much but gladly not (yet) huge either
[15:57] <cpaelzer> it is THE month to get things done, get into the close-out-before-EOY feeling
[15:57] <sarnold> rodrigo did sound optimistic to push exfatprogs over the finish line soon :)
[15:57] <cpaelzer> great
[15:57] <sarnold> we shouldn't schedule our use-it-or-lose-it-PTO rally in the same month
[15:57] <cpaelzer> I think that is it then for today
[15:57] <cpaelzer> yes @sarnold
[15:57] <cpaelzer> #topic Any other business?
[15:57] <slyon> nothing.
[15:57] <jbicha> btw, Desktop intends to file a MIR soon for https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glycin as a dependency for the loupe image viewer. Probably more of a 25.10 project but we are trying to give Security more time.
[15:57] <cpaelzer> enjoy the downtime for some fresh energey next year
[15:57] <sarnold> see you next year :)
[15:58] <jbicha> it's a bit of a next gen gdk-pixbuf
[15:58] <cpaelzer> yeah jbicha, doing that early will help
[15:58] <slyon> jbicha: thanks for the heads up!
[15:58] <sarnold> jbicha: hopefully without a scary warning to the console every single upgrade? :)
[15:58] <cpaelzer> but I assume it will need to exist alongside gdk-pixbuf for a whiel
[15:58] <slyon> if you could file a stub MIR already, that might help to keep it on our radar
[15:58] <sarnold> > The decoding happens in sandboxed modular image loaders
[15:58] <cpaelzer> indeed
[15:58] <sarnold> WOOOHOOO
[15:59] <jbicha> yes, this was filed recently but it's very early: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/Initiatives/-/issues/53
[15:59] <cpaelzer> I want to keep the feeling of hope and call it done for today
[15:59] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Issue 53 in GNOME/Initiatives "Move away from GdkPixbuf" [Opened]
[15:59] <slyon> thanks cpaelzer, all!
[15:59] <cpaelzer> nice to show advantages AND drawbacks
[15:59] <cpaelzer> that background in a stub would indeed already help

[20:08] <amurray> nothing other than a pending AMA I guess :)
[20:08] <rbasak> Does anyone have any comment on my AMA suggestion?
[20:08] <rbasak> I've had no feedback whatsoever except for Seb's question to Merlijn
[20:08] <seb128> indeed, sounds like that's delayed to next year, I guess Mark needs to approve the candidates and didn't reply to the CC yet...
[20:09] <amurray> I think it is a good idea - am not sure if we'll get much engagement but I like the idea of letting folks ask questions to help them clarify their votes and its a chance for the future TB to understand what issues / initiatives are important
[20:09] <seb128> no comment from my part, I'm happy to participate to an AMA session
[20:10] <rbasak> I suppose we might as well make it coincide with a TB meeting because then it shouldn't really be any burden on any candidate.
[20:10] <rbasak> But it seems likely we'll end up with no question!
[20:10] <seb128> similarly I've doubt on whether we will have participation/questions but let's see
[20:11] <amurray> yep - during the next respective TB meeting makes sense to me
[20:11] <seb128> which triggers a side question
[20:11] <seb128> do we need Mark to extend to the memberships?
[20:11] <seb128> since we will not have an election on time now
[20:11] <rbasak> Yes - or any CC member can do it I think.
[20:12] <rbasak> Might as well be Merlijn as he has the best handle on the schedule I think.
[20:12] <seb128> ah, right, they are owner
[20:12] <amurray> perhaps, but I don't think we need the explicit LP membership to have an informal AMA
[20:12] <seb128> I was looking at the admins
[20:12] <seb128> well, the membership is not for AMA
[20:12] <rbasak> amurray: I think seb128 means for regular TB activities and (presumably) emergencies.
[20:12] <seb128> but I do wonder if we hit tasks where we need a TB members for the project at a time where we have none
[20:13] <seb128> I know it was needed at archive opening time for plucky for example
[20:13] <rbasak> eg. if the DMB needs a PPU adding, that sort of thing.
[20:13] <seb128> but yeah, I think it's better to have acrive member in case we need something restricted to TB
[20:14] <amurray> right, I guess I was assuming the election etc would happen quite soon in the new year and so there wouldn't be much need for emergency powers etc - but I suppose it makes more sense to have it ready to go just in case
[20:14] <seb128> I will take an action item to talk to Merlijn about that if you want
[20:14] <amurray> sure
[20:14] <rbasak> Thanks!
[20:14] <seb128> also I will take one to talk to IS/Lukasz about what happened there
[20:14] <amurray> #action seb128 to follow-up with Merlijn about temporarily extending TB memberships
[20:14] <meetingology> ACTION: seb128 to follow-up with Merlijn about temporarily extending TB memberships
[20:14] <rbasak> IS really need to have an allowlist of teams whose memberships continue when a Canonical employee leaves.
[20:15] <seb128> or the opposite, a list of teams they need to manage
[20:15] <amurray> So I saw a mailing list post from Heather around this topic, and I've been meaning to respond as well
[20:15] <seb128> I've seen several cases of people removed to random project they were working on in their freetime after leaving
[20:16] <amurray> (oh I see Heather's email was more about 2FA but is related)
[20:17] <amurray> #link https://lists.launchpad.net/launchpad-users/msg07251.html
[20:17] <seb128> I will share the RT/Cc you if you are interested
[20:17] <amurray> sure - I was going to say I can take an action to follow this up with IS but if there is already a RT then I don't want to duplicate things
[20:20] <amurray> although from the TB side I am happy to take an action to try and drive this forward from our perspective but via any existing RT etc
[20:21] <seb128> either way is fine to me
[20:22] <seb128> pick on, or just list you can me and we can figure out who gets to it first
