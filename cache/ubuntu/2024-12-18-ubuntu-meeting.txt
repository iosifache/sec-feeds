[11:34] <Gyuseok> Hello

[12:02] <Wild_Man> hello yeonguk give us a minute it is very early for us
[12:03] <Kilos> o/
[12:06] <Wild_Man> Morning Gyuseok
[12:06] <Gyuseok> Hello Wild_Man
[12:06] <Wild_Man> Gyuseok, we will be ready in a couple of minutes
[12:08] <Gyuseok> No problem, I'll wait
[12:10] <Wild_Man> #startmeeting Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 18 December 2024. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards
[12:10] <meetingology> Meeting started at 12:10:28 UTC.  The chair is Wild_Man.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology
[12:10] <meetingology> Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick
[12:11] <Wild_Man> Gyuseok, you are up first
[12:11] <Wild_Man> You have signed the Code of Conduct. Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be granted?
[12:12] <Gyuseok> yes I agree
[12:12] <Wild_Man> We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.
[12:13] <Wild_Man> The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).
[12:13] <Wild_Man> Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and
[12:13] <Wild_Man> provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.
[12:14] <Wild_Man> During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.
[12:15] <Wild_Man> When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)
[12:15] <Wild_Man> Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...
[12:16] <Wild_Man> #topic Gyuseok
[12:16] <Wild_Man> topic Gyuseok
[12:17] <Wild_Man> So, first up we have Gyuseok, could you please introduce yourself to the board, share your pre-written statement, and share the links to your wiki page and launchpad accountâ¦

[12:21] <Gyuseok> Hello mapreri
[12:23] <Wild_Man> Please stand by while the board members review the details you've provided, and then I'll invite them to ask any questions they may have
[12:24] <mapreri> I have a question for you: do you see yourself being involved more in the international community side?  I.e., LoCo Council, docs, other ubuntu.com things too, besides "only" Asia?
[12:24] <mapreri> big props for taking part in organizing events btw! â¥
[12:25] <Gyuseok> I also want to be active in the international community, but most of my activities these days are focused on the LoCo.
[12:26] <mapreri> ack, thank you.

[12:47] <Wild_Man> #topic Congratulations to all the new members. Don't forget to check the perks at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership#The_Perks and once you've been added to the members group remember to apply for your certificate at https://forms.canonical.com/certificate/
[12:48] <Wild_Man> Your @ubuntu.com email address will go live within 48 hours. Do NOT set it as your primary launchpad.net email address because that will cause emails to loop forever and you'll never receive them!
[12:48] <zeroday0619> Thank you. I will continue to maintain my activities steadily.
[12:48] <youngbin> @zeroday0619 Congrats :) Keep up good work & hope you can also contribute on other stuff of ubuntu :)
