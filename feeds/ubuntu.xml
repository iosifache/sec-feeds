[11:46] &lt;noob64&gt; Hey guys, I was just doing a system apt upgrade from terminal, and towards the end I got a kind of pop up that took up most of the screen for something related to UEFI and system configuration from boot, and it wanted me to insert a password of at least 8 characters. What is this, and why did it ask for this?
[12:44] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; ...and he's gone
[15:18] &lt;clarkb&gt; out of curiousity is that an expected change?
[15:22] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; it's probably asking for the confirmation password to enroll the local secureboot signing keys...more info here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot
[15:23] &lt;clarkb&gt; got it, thanks
[18:54] &lt;rouca&gt; mdeslaur: just send a mail about GPG
[22:20] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; rouca: thanks, I'll take a look monday morning

[15:10] &lt;bdrung&gt; reading cpete's status, i got reminded to look at the apport PR again
[15:11] &lt;bdmurray&gt; cpete: I might be of some assistance with an SRU test plan for apport.
[15:11] &lt;cpete&gt; bdrung: thank you
[15:12] &lt;bdrung&gt; we need to sru that and also the fix for bug #2067120
[15:12] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2067120 in apport (Ubuntu) "apport-retrace crashed with subprocess.CalledProcessError in check_call(): Command '['dpkg', '-x', '/srv/vms/apport-retrace/Ubuntu 24.04/apt/var/cache/apt/archives//base-files_13ubuntu9_amd64.deb', '/tmp/apport_sandbox_zj9wto2z']' returned non-zero exit status 2."

[15:12] &lt;bdmurray&gt; waveform_: will there be a snap update of rpi-imager?
[15:12] &lt;cpete&gt; bdmurray: that would be great, thanks. I plan to start that next pulse.
[15:12] &lt;waveform_&gt; yes, but while the changes are merged upstream they're not released yet (or weren't when I checked a few days ago)
[15:12] &lt;bdmurray&gt; bdrung: What about the /usr/lib sandbox change?
=== waveform_ is now known as waveform
[15:13] &lt;bdmurray&gt; cpete: I'm out part of next pulse.
[15:14] &lt;bdmurray&gt; bdrung: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apport/+bug/2067120/comments/7 for clarity
[15:14] &lt;bdrung&gt; bdmurray, i need to incorporate your fix (and hopefully add a test case). i'll have an apport session with schopin tomorrow where we can work on that.
[15:14] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2067120 in apport (Ubuntu) "apport-retrace crashed with subprocess.CalledProcessError in check_call(): Command '['dpkg', '-x', '/srv/vms/apport-retrace/Ubuntu 24.04/apt/var/cache/apt/archives//base-files_13ubuntu9_amd64.deb', '/tmp/apport_sandbox_zj9wto2z']' returned non-zero exit status 2." [High, New]
[15:14] &lt;cpete&gt; bdmurray: I'll run my ideas past you sooner then
[15:16] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Skia: Is there any kind of testing of the base images that can be done in jenkins / the upgrade testing?
[15:17] &lt;bdmurray&gt; dbungert: "RESULTS WILL VARY." I like your certainty
[15:18] &lt;juliank&gt; Can we continue, we have a couple of bugs?

[15:18] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 1969394 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "'Settings &amp; Livepatch' button opens 'settings' tab, not livepatch" [Low, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1969394
[15:19] &lt;juliank&gt; This is a desktop+design topic I believe
[15:19] &lt;juliank&gt; Or wellr seb believes
[15:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; agreed
[15:20] &lt;Skia&gt; bdmurray: difficult to say. In that case, the image were booting, but the system just was partially broken afterwards. In any case, the tests were red, meaning we had a look at them, and fixed the issue. The answer might just be that I need to level up in debugging those tests :-)
[15:21] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2063467
[15:21] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2063467 in needrestart (Ubuntu) "needrestart should mark services as needing a restart in systemd" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2063467
[15:21] &lt;juliank&gt; This is a simple quality of life improvement I believe
[15:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; I'm going to argue that's pretty low priority
[15:22] &lt;juliank&gt; We could mark just the services that would need restarting that we didn't
[15:22] &lt;vorlon&gt; compared to all the other things wrong with needrestart :)
[15:22] &lt;vorlon&gt; and thus shouldn't be taken for foundations
[15:22] &lt;schopin&gt; +1 on vorlon's remarks :)
[15:22] &lt;juliank&gt; Untagging
[15:22] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2067350

[15:24] &lt;schopin&gt; doko has been OOO so I think I'll JFDI in glibc in my upcoming merge.
[15:24]  * bdmurray trembles
[15:24] &lt;juliank&gt; I'll assign it to you and tag it todo
[15:24] &lt;schopin&gt; bdmurray: don't worry, I'll warm up the queues first with an openssl sponsoring.
[15:24] &lt;bdmurray&gt; so winter isn't coming? ;-)
[15:24] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2015538
[15:24] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2015538 in dbus-broker (Ubuntu) "[MIR] dbus-broker" [Undecided, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2015538
[15:24] &lt;juliank&gt; this one again
[15:25] &lt;slyon&gt; hehe, maybe. someday
[15:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; not sure why, process-wise, an MIR bug should be in the -incoming queue
[15:25] &lt;slyon&gt; It needs somebody doing the (upstream) work
[15:26] &lt;schopin&gt; vorlon: there's something that needs implementing in there, I believe.
[15:26] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon: The queue part is removing the dbus-run-session dependency from gdm, basically
[15:27] &lt;juliank&gt; There is https://github.com/bus1/dbus-broker/pull/321
[15:27] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Pull 321 in bus1/dbus-broker "session: implement dbus-broker-session" [Open]
[15:27] &lt;juliank&gt; Which is written in Rust
[15:27] &lt;juliank&gt; So bluca doesn't want it :D
[15:28] &lt;juliank&gt; But I guess we can move this to rls-pp-incoming
[15:28] &lt;juliank&gt; And hope the solution is ready then
[15:29] &lt;juliank&gt; Well no objections, so moving it
[15:29] &lt;bdmurray&gt; petable porcupine

[15:30] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2066995
[15:30] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2066995 in apport (Ubuntu) "apport-gtk keeps prompting to report crashes in a loop" [High, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2066995
[15:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; please? :)
[15:31] &lt;bdrung&gt; assign that one to vorlon? ;)
[15:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; D:
[15:31] &lt;bdrung&gt; we need to find the root cause.
[15:31] &lt;schopin&gt; I'm wondering if that's not a whoopsie problem.
[15:32] &lt;juliank&gt; So this only affects vorlon so far and he's the only one who can investigate? :D
[15:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; I assume this is only because none of you are having crashes
[15:32] &lt;juliank&gt; And why don't we log the errno for "could not be opened"
[15:32] &lt;schopin&gt; Well, the looping part is all vorlon, but the failing to deal with Python crashes I also observed.
[15:32] &lt;juliank&gt; I don't have apport but systemd-coredump
[15:32] &lt;juliank&gt; :D
[15:32] &lt;schopin&gt; not a coredump.
[15:33] &lt;bdmurray&gt; cupsd and some bluetooth thing crash for me regularly
[15:33] &lt;bdrung&gt; juliank, you can have both now: systemd-coredump and apport
[15:33] &lt;juliank&gt; I guess that's true
[15:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; bdmurray: this is probably python specific
[15:33] &lt;juliank&gt; I need to set it up, bdrung
[15:33] &lt;bdmurray&gt; vorlon: you didn't say that in your original statement
[15:33] &lt;juliank&gt; Ah ok I just had no apport-gtk
[15:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; bdmurray: the example crash is a python thingy
[15:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; and the only crashes I've had here on noble have been python
[15:34] &lt;juliank&gt; Really need to have an "investigate bug" spike
[15:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; maybe y'all should just run 'grep-merges' :P
[15:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; merges.ubuntu.com will helpfully make this crash
[15:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; and then you can see if it's reproducible!
[15:35] &lt;juliank&gt; I just crashed apport by inserting a raise ValueError
[15:36] &lt;juliank&gt; Well I'll move on
[15:37] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2067622
[15:37] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2067622 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "cryptsetup-initramfs disappeared during upgrade from 23.10 to 24.04 leading to failing boot" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2067622
[15:37] &lt;bdmurray&gt; oof
[15:37] &lt;juliank&gt; That seems straightforward, no, ubuntu-release-upgrader has a flag to make it protect some packages
[15:38] &lt;juliank&gt; Broken cryptsetup-initramfs:amd64 Depends on cryptsetup:amd64 &lt; 2:2.7.0-1ubuntu4 @ii pgP &gt; (&gt;= 2:2.7.0-1ubuntu4)
[15:38] &lt;juliank&gt; It doesn't help that we break users by purging all packages during the upgrade
[15:39] &lt;juliank&gt; Assigning to Nick, targetting, and tagging
[15:39] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2067916
[15:39] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2067916 in glibc (Ubuntu Noble) "libc6: broken utmp handling in 32-bit programs with 64-bit time_t" [Medium, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2067916
[15:39] &lt;schopin&gt; Ah. Yes.
[15:40] &lt;schopin&gt; Just wanted to discuss the severity of this.
[15:40] &lt;juliank&gt; If it crashes it should get fixed
[15:40] &lt;juliank&gt; :D
[15:40] &lt;bdmurray&gt; but how soon?
[15:40] &lt;juliank&gt; ASAR
[15:40] &lt;schopin&gt; Not actually sure it crashes?
[15:40] &lt;juliank&gt; :D
[15:41] &lt;juliank&gt; If the data is just garbled but not crashing that may be um not critical
[15:41] &lt;schopin&gt; I mean, the crash would be for last(1) and a few other tools.
[15:41] &lt;schopin&gt; And only if they're upgrading.
[15:42] &lt;juliank&gt; But yeah medium seems fine
[15:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; things crashing on malformed utmp would almost certainly be security issues that should have been fixed 20 years ago
[15:42] &lt;juliank&gt; I guess they are not setuid binaries that crash
[15:43] &lt;juliank&gt; Anyway I'll go tag this and assign it to schopin
[15:43] &lt;schopin&gt; ACK
[15:43] &lt;schopin&gt; to the backlog it goes :)
[15:43] &lt;juliank&gt; OK rls-mm just has the usual 2 desktop bugs masquerading in foundations queue :D

[15:45] &lt;juliank&gt; Oh I think they directly installed to a luks partition, rather than use lvm
[15:45] &lt;schopin&gt; Oh wow, 6 digits!
[15:45] &lt;bdrung&gt; schopin, 5 digits is needed for a "wow"
[15:45] &lt;vorlon&gt; definitely shouldn't be accepted via the incoming queue, based solely on the bug number :)(

[15:48] &lt;vorlon&gt; pyopenssl still stuck - adrien this was assigned to you, and I think you're still working on it wrt python-oauth2client and its revdeps?
[15:51] &lt;vorlon&gt; gcc-13 I see as 'candidate' but it hasn't moved. bdrung can you take this? means digging into update_output.txt
[15:51] &lt;bdrung&gt; vorlon, i still have dracut vs systemd
[15:51] &lt;vorlon&gt; dbungert: ^ can you take this?
[15:52] &lt;vorlon&gt; cpete: you still have libsub-override-perl yes? (MIR)
[15:52] &lt;adrien&gt; vorlon: yes, still on it; there's a few packages left
[15:52] &lt;cpete&gt; vorlon: yes

[15:52] &lt;vorlon&gt; dbungert: sorry, I meant can you take gcc-13 - leaving dracut v systemd with bdrung
[15:53] &lt;dbungert&gt; ah, sorry
[15:53] &lt;dbungert&gt; ack for gcc-13
[15:53] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon: Well yes, that should sort itself out with the next apt upload
[15:53] &lt;vorlon&gt; git: danilogondolfo?
[15:53] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; ack
[15:53] &lt;adrien&gt; vorlon: cinder, python-googleapi done; pydrive sorted out (removal); beancount, fence-agents, python-certbot-dns-google: need to be worked upon; pydrive2: not obvious how to deal with it (assess whether we can remove stuff from python-oauth2client and vendor?)
[15:54] &lt;vorlon&gt; systemd: enr0n uploaded but he's out this week. ginggs?
[15:54] &lt;ginggs&gt; ack
[15:54] &lt;vorlon&gt; and then that's the list
[15:55] &lt;bdrung&gt; we have fakeroot 1.35-1 that FTBFS
[15:55] &lt;adrien&gt; well, I have at least one revdep of python-googleapi that will need attention...
[15:55] &lt;schopin&gt; all arches or armhf?
[15:55] &lt;schopin&gt; oh, all arches. Not t64, good :)
[15:55] &lt;bdrung&gt; fakeroot ftbfs on all archs (except riscv64)
[15:56] &lt;bdrung&gt; so who want to take it?
[15:56] &lt;bdrung&gt; or vorlon to pick a volunteer
[15:56] &lt;zhsj&gt; i can take

[22:16] &lt;mapreri&gt; Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for June 7th 2024. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards
[22:17] &lt;mapreri&gt; Today we only have one applicant, whom is here already, and we also have a quorum, so I see no reason as to why we shouldn't be able to handle it today!
[22:17] &lt;mapreri&gt; Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.
[22:17] &lt;mapreri&gt; During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.
[22:17] &lt;mapreri&gt; When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)
[22:17] &lt;mapreri&gt; Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...
[22:17] &lt;mapreri&gt; #topic Bright Adams &lt; Mrbite &gt;
[22:18] &lt;mapreri&gt; Mrbite: please introduce yourself and share your links to IRC as well.
[22:20] &lt;mapreri&gt; Mrbite: ?
[22:22] &lt;Mrbite&gt; My name is Bright Adams. Am a blockchain Developer and am here to express my interest for Ubuntu membership.
[22:22] &lt;Mrbite&gt; Will drop links sooner.
[22:23] &lt;Mrbite&gt; https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/locos/ubuntu-ng/155
[22:23] &lt;Mrbite&gt; This link directs you to some of our accomplishemts.
[22:24] &lt;Mrbite&gt; https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/bright-adams-membership-application/44254
[22:25] &lt;mapreri&gt; could I ask you why on discourse you are part of the ubuntu-unity-devs team, whereas I can't find any sort of connection anywhere else (especially in lpâ¦)?
[22:27] &lt;mapreri&gt; also, could you confirm to us that indeed your first contribution to the community was roughly one year ago?
[22:27] &lt;Mrbite&gt; I really can't say how I got that tag.
[22:28] &lt;Mrbite&gt; Yes, roughly a year ago.
[22:28] &lt;mapreri&gt; ack.
[22:29] &lt;mapreri&gt; On discourse, you state "I am eager to continue my contributions to the Ubuntu community and to work towards its goals" - could you possibly be a bit more specific about what you'd like to engage in?
[22:30] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; I count 10 months contributing - with huge efforts.
[22:32] &lt;Mrbite&gt; Continue to contribute to the Ubuntu Comm. and further its growth.
[22:33] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; Mrbite: What does attaining Ubuntu membership mean to you, personally ?
[22:35] &lt;Mrbite&gt; Getting Ubuntu membership means a lot to me
[22:35] &lt;Mrbite&gt; It feels like I'm part of something bigger and important. ...Plus, it pushes me to keep learning and doing more.
[22:36] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; :)
[22:36] &lt;Kilos&gt; Mrbite: have you been to your discourse pages again ?
[22:36] &lt;Mrbite&gt; Not yet
[22:36] &lt;Kilos&gt; there are links to other countries in africa that also use ubuntu
[22:37] &lt;Kilos&gt; I think I collected them all in 2016 or soon after
[22:37] &lt;Mrbite&gt; Ye i saw the link Bashing-om sent.
[22:38] &lt;Mrbite&gt; Okay thats great, what do you suggest I do wit them?
[22:38] &lt;Kilos&gt; please follow up on them
[22:38] &lt;Mrbite&gt; Why are they not on the discourse?
[22:39] &lt;Kilos&gt; encourage them , when freenode crashed many of them left irc
[22:39] &lt;Kilos&gt; discourse is newish
[22:39] &lt;Kilos&gt; we used launchpad and the wiki before
[22:40] &lt;Mrbite&gt; Ohhh Thats right.
[22:40] &lt;Mrbite&gt; Will do just that.
[22:40] &lt;Kilos&gt; thank you
[22:42] &lt;mapreri&gt; I likewise encourage you to look a bit into a bit of "history" of the project, as there have been changes over the years (and there are still changes ongoing, like how IRC is slowly being replaced by matrix).  but a community as wide as Ubuntu's can be slow to move and adapt. :)
[22:42] &lt;mapreri&gt; You'll easily find pieces left over from our predecessors and have been abandoned here and there... (not necessarily what you need, but some finds can be pretty interesting and amusing heh)
[22:43] &lt;Mrbite&gt; Ye... thats right.
[22:43] &lt;mapreri&gt; Kilos, Bashing-om: would you be ready to vote?
[22:43] &lt;Mrbite&gt; Will look into that.
[22:43] &lt;mapreri&gt; or would you like more time?
[22:43] &lt;Kilos&gt; mapreri: yip
[22:43] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; yup
[22:43] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; ready to vote.

[22:44] &lt;Kilos&gt; and a +1 from wildman
[22:45] &lt;mapreri&gt; +1 - what you have done in this little time is honestly quite amazing, going from next to nothing to such nice meetups!  However for me normally I'd consider contributions in such short timeframe not quite enough.  I pretty much giving this +1 in the hope that you'll continue strong in spreading Ubuntu around Nigeria, and Africa as a whole! :)

[14:37] &lt;jbicha&gt; I plan to finish filling out https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/TestPlans/Sysprof and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/TestPlans/GnomeBuilder today
[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; awesome
[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I can have a look at a review tomorrow
[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; If the test process is complete by then that would be great

[14:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; liiking for volunteers now
[14:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; "looking"
[14:40] &lt;joalif&gt; i can have one
[14:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I also like review volunteers though
[14:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; libdex or libpanel - any preference joalif?
[14:41] &lt;slyon&gt; I'm off next week, but could take one for the week after.
[14:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; btw jamespage - I saw your "o/" - sorry for sending you a mail - have you seen the two mismatches above?
[14:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok slyon, I think that is better than no reviewer :-)
[14:41] &lt;joalif&gt; libdex please
[14:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; done
[14:42] &lt;joalif&gt; thanks
[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: maybe you can come to the "needs security review" yes/no this week - to enqueue it there before you are out?
[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; only if it is a trivial call to make, and anything in depth is fine for when you are back
[14:43] &lt;slyon&gt; my "distro day" for this week is almost over, not sure if I can make that
[14:43] &lt;sarnold&gt; good idea :)
[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; WDYT slyon - is that possible - or is that breaking your planned tasks before you leave?
[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: ok, give it a best effort try if you can
[14:43] &lt;slyon&gt; ok
[14:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; not wasting time discussing it further, you see sarnold would appreciate it :-)

[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks jamespage
[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I like both PRs, short, concise and to the point
[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon:  has approved one already
[14:46] &lt;slyon&gt; just approved the 2nd one
[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'll give both a check tomorrow
[14:47] &lt;eslerm&gt; thank you slyon and cpaelzer
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and if I'm +1 as well merge them and fix the silly spelling check issue

[14:48] &lt;slyon&gt; I reviewed bug #2067373 today. I think it can be queued for security already, while desktop works out the kinks

[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, I'm sure sarnold can add that there right?
[14:48] &lt;sarnold&gt; yup!
[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: maybe an expectation on when s3transfer and boto3 will get started?
[14:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; cpaelzer: I expect one should start this week, unsure of how many more
[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; as long as they not continue to just wait we are ok atm I guess
[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but you can expect some more to come to your queue
[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; like 3 of sysprof we've seen above are likely
[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; with that in mind, going on ...

[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think we are good for today

[19:06] &lt;seb128&gt; amurray, rbasak, I think it's only the 3 of us, worth having a quick meeting still?
[19:06] &lt;amurray&gt; yeah I think so
[19:06] &lt;seb128&gt; our chair and backup chair are missing, amurray you would be next in the list following the membership order

[19:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; 1. The requirement for the documented test plan
[19:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; 2. The section on specific mechanism for implementation for snaps via snap channels.
[19:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; These are marked in green in the draft.
[19:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; Final call: if you haven't provided feedback yet, I'm going to assume you're OK with the current wording (as a draft for publication for consultation; there would still be a final TB ratification step).
[19:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; Also please note that I've renumbered the requirements and started calling them "principles" to help with clarity
[19:10] &lt;amurray&gt; sounds reasonable

[19:12] &lt;amurray&gt; new changes lgtm fwiw
[19:12] &lt;seb128&gt; +1 from me also
[19:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks!
[19:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; I've also been speaking to some internal stakeholders such as snap upstream.
[19:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; Assuming no objections from them, I'll publish to Discourse in the next couple of weeks or so.
[19:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; My draft to post to Discourse is in progress in the same doc.
[19:13] &lt;amurray&gt; sounds good - thanks rbasak
[19:14] &lt;amurray&gt; (argh sorry I just realised I have a hard stop in 15 mins so will speed things up a bit - apologies)
[19:14] &lt;amurray&gt; ACTION: rbasak to draft a proposal of the DMB-proposed inactivity expiration policy for TB ratification
[19:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; This is a lower priority so I've not touched it. Please carry over.
[19:14] &lt;seb128&gt; (sounds fine, I don't expect there is any pending topic that should turn it into a long meeting)

[19:15] &lt;amurray&gt; yep - thanks rbasak

[19:19] &lt;sil2100&gt; Oh no
[19:20] &lt;amurray&gt; all good - main thing to know would be to raise any issues you have may with the third-party repo requirements doc asap

I realise this is a lot longer than you wanted to wait - please let me know your thoughts (I'm eod but will check in the morning tomorrow)
[14:06] &lt;mcphail&gt; amurray: that's fine. I appreciate there's a lot in the queue already :) . Just don't want it to slip indefinitely. Thanks for your help

[15:05] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Skia: What was the kernel bug regarding autopkgtest that might have been related to bug 2063094?

[15:08] &lt;bdmurray&gt; adrien: There was a thought that bug 2056461 might be related to your unattended-upgrades bug.
[15:08] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2056461 in linux (Ubuntu) "autopkgtest-virt-qemu on noble images sometimes hangs doing copydown" [Undecided, In Progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2056461
[15:09] &lt;Skia&gt; there, you found it, sorry for the delay, I was busy posting my status late :/
[15:10] &lt;Skia&gt; (I also lost some time diving into adrien's new excuse page, it looks great!)
[15:10] &lt;adrien&gt; oh, that's a bit surprising
[15:10] &lt;adrien&gt; host kernel is 6.1.0-15-amd64
[15:11] &lt;adrien&gt; Skia: :)
[15:11] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I was seeing it on noble as was apw
[15:11] &lt;adrien&gt; it's not the first time I see that issue but I can't tell when was the first time
[15:11] &lt;adrien&gt; bdmurray: considering that seb had a very different backtrace, I wouldn't be surprised there are several bugs
[15:12] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Hrm, I'm not seeing bug 2056461 in the changelog for our linux package though...

[15:14] &lt;adrien&gt; also, I'll be running dbus-monitor for a while; we'll see if something changes from there
[15:14] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Skia: Could you check with the kernel team about the fix?
[15:15] &lt;Skia&gt; sure
[15:16] &lt;bdrung&gt; done with reading and ready to move on?
[15:17] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I've finished reading

[15:18] &lt;schopin&gt; No oo incoming?
[15:18] &lt;bdrung&gt; (doing nn before oo)
[15:19] &lt;bdrung&gt; that bug needs triaging.
[15:20] &lt;bdrung&gt; schopin, could you have a look at it?
[15:21] &lt;schopin&gt; hem, that's a weird one?
[15:22] &lt;bdrung&gt; yes
[15:23] &lt;bdrung&gt; should we keep it in incoming until next week to have it triaged by then?
[15:23] &lt;schopin&gt; OK with me. I'll spend some time looking over the logs in details.
[15:24] &lt;bdrung&gt; ok. next: bug #2067120
[15:24] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2067120 in apport (Ubuntu) "apport-retrace crashed with subprocess.CalledProcessError in check_call(): Command '['dpkg', '-x', '/srv/vms/apport-retrace/Ubuntu 24.04/apt/var/cache/apt/archives//base-files_13ubuntu9_amd64.deb', '/tmp/apport_sandbox_zj9wto2z']' returned non-zero exit status 2."

[15:25] &lt;bdrung&gt; @bdmurray, i suggested a fix for what i could see. Can you test if that fixes it for you as well?
[15:25] &lt;bdrung&gt; IMO we can tag this one as foundations-todo
[15:25] &lt;bdmurray&gt; bdrung: I will test it today
[15:26] &lt;bdrung&gt; okay. tagged.
[15:27] &lt;bdrung&gt; bug #2063094
[15:27] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2063094 in unattended-upgrades (Ubuntu) "unattended-upgrades is running forever" [High, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2063094
[15:31] &lt;bdrung&gt; this is the bug @Skia talked about previously
[15:32] &lt;bdrung&gt; should we tag it? it looks important enough to me and @adrien provided logs (i did not look into unattended-upgrades-bt.tar.xz)
[15:33] &lt;ogayot&gt; I also think we should tag it
[15:34] &lt;bdrung&gt; tagged
[15:34] &lt;Skia&gt; I think it's bdmurray that mentionned it, I don't have any context on this one, but I only know that it might be linked to LP#2056461 that I investigated from a very different angle
[15:34] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2056461 in linux (Ubuntu) "autopkgtest-virt-qemu on noble images sometimes hangs doing copydown" [Undecided, In Progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2056461
[15:34] &lt;schopin&gt; do we have enough to debug it?
[15:34] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Based of what adrien said I'm somewhat concerned issues are being conflated here
[15:35] &lt;adrien&gt; I'm a bit surprised with the stacks I've been seeing: I would have assumed they don't take CPU time
[15:36] &lt;adrien&gt; maybe the same operation fails repeatedly and is re-tried however
[15:36] &lt;adrien&gt; but I was also planning to wait for Julian to look at the traces before thinking more about the issue
[15:36] &lt;bdrung&gt; adrien, will you carry that bug forward?
[15:37] &lt;bdrung&gt; next: bug #2067071
[15:37] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2067071 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "cannot upgrade from 23.10 to 24.04, error in _install_t64_replacement_packages" [High, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2067071
[15:37] &lt;bdrung&gt; oh, i see "TypeError: apport_excepthook() missing 1 required positional argument: 'exc_tb'" in there
[15:38] &lt;bdrung&gt; the python stack trace looks simple enough to debug that. any objections to tagging it?
[15:38] &lt;adrien&gt; bdrung: no, I don't have time for that, especially since I'm not familiar with that and also since python-auth2client will be quite some work
[15:39] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Let's hold leave the uanttended-upgrades bug for next week then
[15:39] &lt;bdmurray&gt; enr0n: Are there any duplicates of bug 2067071?
[15:39] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2067071 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "cannot upgrade from 23.10 to 24.04, error in _install_t64_replacement_packages" [High, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2067071
[15:39] &lt;enr0n&gt; Yeah we should definitely take this. I wanted Julian's input on why the _cand would be None
[15:39] &lt;enr0n&gt; bdmurray: maybe, but I have not had time yet to go through all the recent bug reports
[15:40] &lt;bdrung&gt; tagged

[15:50] &lt;schopin&gt; as far as glibc is concerned I'm OK with this, but I'd like doko's ACK on it for the gcc part?

[16:28] &lt;mkukri&gt; merging cryptsetup requires new openssl. unless someone else uploaded a cryptsetup the regression should be unrelated

[14:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I hope you handled all that is caused by syncs last week :-P
[14:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok
[14:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; no MIR bugs, so we need to bring them up

[14:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; python-pint -&gt; requirejs and pydata-sphinx-theme
[14:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; reads like documentation

[14:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; there is no strict reason for the doc package to be in main

[14:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; jamespage: also openstack

[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we might mark them as that .. hmm

[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: do you think you could provide a PR that wraps the consensus mentioned by slyon into words
[14:46] &lt;eslerm&gt; I can
[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks in advance
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/55
[14:47] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Issue 55 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "end-of-cycle unexpected changes" [Open]
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; has tackled the obvious things
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the rest is "looking for volunteers" to tackle more
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; speak up if anyone wants to ... :-)
[14:48] &lt;eslerm&gt; possibly, we could add that an owning teams director needs to request late MIRs
[14:48] &lt;eslerm&gt; we had a last second libyuv request, which ended up not beeing needed after ack'd
[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; there's a few cases to care for -- one with the "the team didn't plan" and then the "oh upstream or debian has walked away from package foo because they're switching to package bar"
[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; i think our "you get to talk to the director of security engineering" is a decent speedbump to discourage the first one, but I wish we could come up with some clever ideas to spot the overlooked packages
[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm happy with adding "bring high level for late requests"
[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; bring wording in a PR for that for discussion please
[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; for the other case let us brainstorm for 3 minutes ...
[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; It plays into the "re-evaluate things in main" TBH
[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; which we asked for but got denied for resourcing
[14:51] &lt;eslerm&gt; that's not what I mean with #22
[14:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; storm idea one, look for new Replaces: or maybe dropped Depends: from other packages?
[14:52] &lt;eslerm&gt; it is for cases where there is ack for the MIR, but then owning team goes idle for a long period of time (say 2 years)
[14:52] &lt;eslerm&gt; I am okay dropping issue though
[14:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; storm idea two, look for new packages with small levenstein distances from packages already in main
[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: I think we usually get signal by bugs, the cases I see crashing as where responsibility and ownership is unclear.
[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: which does not mean I'd not like a scanner that provides extra signal
[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: now I got you - like "what is the consequence if they make us busy and then walk away" ?
[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: I'm not sure, but things change - so that can not always be prevented IMHO.
[14:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: not sure if defining negative consequences would help, or did you have something completely different in mind?
[14:54] &lt;eslerm&gt; mostly, this occured and then a package was added to main, and I believe it should have had a quick re-review first
[14:54] &lt;eslerm&gt; it's not about negative consequences for us doing the work, just that more work is needed if a review has gone "stale"
[14:55] &lt;slyon&gt; so adding something like a timeout on an ACK?
[14:55] &lt;eslerm&gt; yes, I proposed 2 years
[14:56] &lt;slyon&gt; sounds reasonable to me.
[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm +1 on timeout on an Ack
[14:56] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: that would be like our re-review idea, but only for things that didn't make it into "main" yet.
[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; While we do not get a re-review, if it didn't make it into main it is fine to time out
[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: exactly
[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; anyone willing to provide a wording PR for that?
[14:57] &lt;eslerm&gt; I can propose a PR
[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thank you
[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; uh, time flies

[00:12] &lt;amurray&gt; blahdeblah: yeah that is a great idea - it would be really interesting to do the analysis to (hopefully) show that since we rebase our kernels on the various stable trees etc that we do not suffer from this
[00:13] &lt;blahdeblah&gt; amurray: Yeah, my feeling after reading it was similar, and I did question their methodology a bit, but not being an expert in the area I couldn't be definitive.
[00:15] &lt;amurray&gt; or perhaps it would be enough just to compare open CVEs in our kernels vs RHEL (but in general I don't think anything good ever comes of doing direct comparisons with our peers, particularly if we do it and then try and say  - "look how much more secure we are") - instead would just be good to show an analysis that reassures users that Ubuntu *is* secure since we do incorporate all the patches and leave out the comparison bit

[19:30] &lt;ahasenack&gt; georgiag: hi, I just had a bug filed about something I wasn't expecting in apparmor rules,
[19:30] &lt;ahasenack&gt; georgiag: impact of usr-merge in apparmor profiles, when ugprading from pre-usr-merge distros
[19:30] &lt;ahasenack&gt; case in point was bionic -&gt; focal upgrade
[19:30] &lt;ahasenack&gt; in fresh bionic: /bin/uname
[19:30] &lt;ahasenack&gt; in fresh focal: /usr/bin/uname
[19:31] &lt;ahasenack&gt; in focal upgraded from bionic: /bin/uname
[19:31] &lt;ahasenack&gt; (uname is just an example: anything in /bin/ in bionic, if present in an apparmor rule that does not use /{,usr/}, will fail in the upgraded system
[19:32] &lt;ahasenack&gt; I had a nice "%if bionic" in the apparmor template, and was accounting for these differences where needed, but always assuming the "fresh" installation case
[19:32] &lt;ahasenack&gt; this upgrade-from-bionic got me
[19:33] &lt;ahasenack&gt; do you remember similar bugs back in 2020 (focal's release), from people upgrading from bionic to focal? Just trying to get some an idea if there is a pattern to addressing this
[19:34] &lt;georgiag&gt; ahasenack: I will have to dig a little bit to find out if there are/were other cases.
[19:34] &lt;ahasenack&gt; no need, if you don't remember, then they were likely not important or relevant
[19:35] &lt;georgiag&gt; I had this issue in one of the apparmor tests actually
[19:35] &lt;ahasenack&gt; or common
[19:36] &lt;georgiag&gt; I joined in 2021 so there might be some cases I haven't looked at yet :)
[19:36] &lt;ahasenack&gt; hah :)
[19:42] &lt;sdeziel&gt; in custom made profile, this usr-merge difference on dist-upgraded machines also bit me, annoying ;)
[19:42] &lt;ahasenack&gt; yeah
[19:42] &lt;ahasenack&gt; I'm going over every bin invocation
[19:42] &lt;ahasenack&gt; so far it's ps and uname
[19:42] &lt;ahasenack&gt; ah, and systemctl
[19:43] &lt;ahasenack&gt; these live in /bin in bionic

[16:07] &lt;kanashiro&gt; do we have quorum with 3 people out of 7?
[16:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; do we _plan_ to hold elections, though?
[16:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; kanashiro: "technically" there's only 4 members in the board atm, hehe. 3/4 are here, so technically we have quorum, hehe.

[22:35] &lt;NovaShadow&gt; hey, just wanted if you guys have ever successfully filtered outbound traffic with iptables. I'm struggling to get apt[-get] data in and out while not wholeheartedly permitting 80,443 traffic. +10 points if you've done so using -m owner --uid -_-
[22:56] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; NovaShadow: I wasn't even able to do NAT with iptables :P
[22:56] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; but this is probably the wrong channel. You might try EITHER #ubuntu OR #networking (don't cross-post to both).
[23:16] &lt;NovaShadow&gt; I can probably help you with NAT
[23:17] &lt;NovaShadow&gt; they have an accurate account of what to do for that in arch wiki. "Simple stateful firewall."
[23:22] &lt;NovaShadow&gt; arraybolt3: any ideas on a tool that would let me track the process to figure out process ownership?
[23:31] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; NovaShadow: That's probably also an #ubuntu question.
[23:31] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; This is the Ubuntu Security Team's development and collaboration room, #ubuntu is the user technical support room.
[23:31] &lt;NovaShadow&gt; fair, thank you for your suggestion

[00:19] &lt;JanC&gt; it might not be a major or easy to exploit issue...
[00:20] &lt;JanC&gt; (so not "critical")
[00:31] &lt;sarnold&gt; expat gets linked into a lot of things though
[00:31] &lt;sarnold&gt; so it might be limited only by creativity, heh
[01:00] &lt;amurray&gt; mcphail: no need to apologise here - we are the ones dragging the chain - fyi there seems to be some confusion internally around this issue so I am continuing to liase with the development team to get to a conclusion
[05:56] &lt;brittluna&gt; amurray: listening to this weeks Ubuntu Security Podcast now, while applying security updates on the Ubuntu servers at work in Sweden from the partner in England atm :p

[12:16] &lt;ricotz&gt; ebarretto, thank you, I will try to keep an eye on them

[14:20] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; amavisd-new also in the same repo
[14:33] &lt;sdeziel&gt; mdeslaur: happy to test amavisd-new (sad that I'm still using that piece of software) on Jammy
[14:36] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; sdeziel: awesome! that would be great
[14:40] &lt;sdeziel&gt; mdeslaur: amavisd-new on Jammy (`1:2.12.2-1ubuntu1.1`) has no problem doing DKIM verification/signing and otherwise inspecting mails for spam. I did not specifically test this new `CC_UNCHECKED,3` bit though
[14:44] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; sdeziel: great, thanks for the test!
[14:45] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; IOU $BEER
[14:51] &lt;sdeziel&gt; huh, so I'd get a free security fix and $BEER, that's a way to make people happy :P

[07:39] &lt;ogayot&gt; adrien: no I didn't. That was just before feature freeze so it wasn't really an option at the time
[10:23] &lt;adrien&gt; ogayot: ok, thanks; I only looked at one revdep ("google-something") and noticed it's at version 1.x and there's 2.x which is still updated; no idea about other revdeps though and it doesn't mean it's not more sensible to patch the package now and do the migration over a long timeframe (I'll see next week, I'm off until tuesday)

[11:44] &lt;mcphail&gt; Hi. WRT cve-2024-1724 again, this was disclosed 20th Feb, patched 13th March and fix deployed through April. I haven't had any communication from the upstream team about disclosure, so unless there is a compelling and credible reason not to I intend to publish a wee blog post tomorrow.

When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be provided. &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1724&gt;
[11:48] &lt;ebarretto&gt; amurray, ^
[11:50] &lt;ebarretto&gt; mcphail, have you seen the email thread answer from amurray ?
[11:53] &lt;mcphail&gt; ebarretto: no - haven't been included in any emails since 12th April where Alex had suggested an update in a few days
[11:54] &lt;ebarretto&gt; mcphail, yes, that's the one. I think they still need a couple more days. amurray might be able to confirm tomorrow as he is already EOD by now I think 
[11:58] &lt;mcphail&gt; Ok, thanks ebarretto. Happy to hold off if there is progress but coming up to a very busy period at work just now and keen to get simple things tidied up
[13:08] &lt;amurray&gt; mcphail: apologies again .. I'm just checking once more with the associated development team (my contact their appears to be offline atm and I'm about to go to bed myself but will post back in my morning what their response is)
[13:39] &lt;mcphail&gt; Thanks amurray . Sorry to keep troubling you
[16:51] &lt;UnivrslSuprBox&gt; There's a change in `apparmor (4.0.1-0ubuntu1) oracular` described as "Add condition in policydb serialization to only encode xtable if kernel_supports_permstable32". This change allows oracular's apparmor_parser to load `abstractions/opencl-pocl` on Ubuntu kernel 5.15 from jammy. noble's apparmor_parser cannot load that abstraction into jammy's kernel.
[16:51] &lt;UnivrslSuprBox&gt; I unfortunately have a usecase where I'm doing just that (loading noble's policy into jammy's kernel) which I know is worth telling me to go away for
[16:52] &lt;UnivrslSuprBox&gt; But, is that change candidate for backport from oracular to noble?
[16:53] &lt;ebarretto&gt; georgiag, ^
[16:55] &lt;UnivrslSuprBox&gt; Happy to file bugs and do any needful there, but I didn't want to start with that if the answer here was "kindly go pound sand" :P
[17:04] &lt;georgiag&gt; UnivrslSuprBox: yes, that change is on its way onto the noble apparmor package. we had to wait until it was in oracular to start the SRU process. I'm tracking the SRU here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apparmor/+bug/2064672
[17:04] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- Launchpad bug 2064672 in apparmor (Ubuntu) "[SRU] - fixes for apparmor on noble" [Undecided, New]
[17:06] &lt;georgiag&gt; UnivrslSuprBox: that scenario is not that uncommon given that you could have a noble lxd container running on jammy, which would be using jammy's kernel... if you need it urgently, you could use the ppa I linked in the bug https://launchpad.net/~georgiag/+archive/ubuntu/apparmor-4.0.1-redo/+packages, since it's going to take a couple of weeks to complete the SRU process
[17:06] &lt;UnivrslSuprBox&gt; Oh, excellent. Thank you!
[17:06] &lt;georgiag&gt; UnivrslSuprBox: no problem. let me know if you run into any issues
[19:17] &lt;ahasenack&gt; uh, expat 2.6.2 has this interesting Changes entry: https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/blob/R_2_6_2/expat/Changes#L14
[19:17] &lt;ahasenack&gt; "(help with) fixing a complex non-public security issue"

[15:21] &lt;adrien&gt; also, I'm preparing openssl 3.2 so I might delay/skip some things if they're related to openssl 3.0
[15:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; libsub-override-perl appears to need an MIR. Any volunteers?
[15:21] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon: fwupd-efi is awkward but I think  you can reject the binaries, it's a sync that needs to go through the signing PPA workflow instead, so rejecting the binaries and building them in the uefi build PPA is probably the best idea
[15:22] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: sure. have we been rerouting fwupd-efi through the signing ppa?  or have we been just signing them with the old and useless key :)
[15:22] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: anyway you and I can coordinate
[15:23] &lt;vorlon&gt; libsub-override-perl: cpete
[15:23] &lt;vorlon&gt; numpy: dbungert
[15:23] &lt;dbungert&gt; ack
[15:23] &lt;cpete&gt; vorlon: ack
[15:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; llvm-toolchain-18: will punt this to locutusofborg for the moment
[15:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; systemd: enr0n are you already on this?
[15:24] &lt;enr0n&gt; vorlon: yes indeed
[15:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok then that's everything for this week
[15:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank:
[15:24] &lt;ginggs&gt; llvm-toolchain-18 just waiting on riscv64 build, i believe
[15:24] &lt;juliank&gt; #topic AOB
[15:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; ginggs: confirmed
[15:25] &lt;juliank&gt; I should take 2nd half of next week off but I haven't filed that yet :D
[15:25] &lt;bdrung_&gt; schopin, you forgot to mention apport reviews in your status update!
[15:26] &lt;schopin&gt; Next week we need to do the assignments in reverse order :)
[15:26] &lt;adrien&gt; python-oauth2client uses an API that has been removed from pyopenssl; project has been dead for years; let's kill it this time?
[15:27] &lt;schopin&gt; bdrung_: nah, it was all done in &lt;30mn, not worth mentioning ;)
[15:27] &lt;adrien&gt; I'll be off tomorrow and monday
[15:28] &lt;schopin&gt; adrien: good luck with killing it, it has a few rdeps.
[15:28] &lt;ogayot&gt; adrien: I tried to drop it last cycle and ended up fixing it
[15:28] &lt;juliank&gt; I have 5 APT test cases to analyse and possibly fix for the new solver and then the first batch is over
[15:29] &lt;juliank&gt; Or I should say the first round, not first batch :)
[15:29] &lt;adrien&gt; ogayot: ah, I remembered some things but I didn't know you had actually tried to drop it :/
[15:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; next Monday is a US holiday
[15:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; National Grilling Day
[15:29] &lt;juliank&gt; This is all the easy fixes so we have the test suite working for bigger solver changes
[15:29] &lt;juliank&gt; Also Saturday is a towel day
[15:29] &lt;zhsj&gt; i'll be off tomorrow as well.
[15:30] &lt;juliank&gt; OK let's wrap up here!

[07:58] &lt;LocutusOfBorg&gt; hello, is anybody trying or working to update openssl?
[07:59] &lt;LocutusOfBorg&gt; nodejs needs openssl 3.2
[07:59] &lt;LocutusOfBorg&gt; schopin, ^^
[08:00] &lt;schopin&gt; LocutusOfBorg: do they need &gt;= 3.2 or == 3.2 ?
[08:02] &lt;schopin&gt; also, you want adrien now. These days he's the lead on all things crypto for Foundations, I'm just the backup singer.
[08:05] &lt;LocutusOfBorg&gt; is adrien somewhere on irc?
[08:05] &lt;LocutusOfBorg&gt; well, I don't know, probably &lt;= 3.2 is good
[08:05] &lt;LocutusOfBorg&gt; &gt;=
[08:06] &lt;LocutusOfBorg&gt; I'm disabling some openssl test that are failing, and I have some guess that they won't fail with newer openssl

[14:34] &lt;slyon&gt; o/ Do we have quorum for a MIR meeting? I see some people are out..
[14:36] &lt;dviererbe&gt; Doesn't look like it :/
[14:39] &lt;jbicha&gt; heads up that Desktop is working on filing a MIR for sysprof (bug 2066269) which will have 2 dependent MIRs. I expect it will need Security review
[14:39] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2066269 in sysprof (Ubuntu) "[MIR] sysprof" [Undecided, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2066269
[14:39] &lt;slyon&gt; status looks pretty much as last time (2 weeks ago). A much of component mismatches, mostly for openstack and desktop teams, but also one new for foundations. One request to promote a split out package from desktop and the heads up from jbicha ^
[14:39] &lt;slyon&gt; Otherwise, no updates
[14:39] &lt;slyon&gt; thanks jbicha for raising it early!

[19:08] &lt;seb128&gt; ACTION: rbasak to open wider discussion on third-party repo policy
[19:08] &lt;seb128&gt; in fact that's probably the one that we should keep?
[19:08] &lt;amurray&gt; yeah I think so
[19:09] &lt;seb128&gt; #undo
[19:09] &lt;meetingology&gt; Removing item from minutes: ACTION

[19:12] &lt;sil2100&gt; Didn't hear anything about that sadly
[19:12] &lt;sil2100&gt; The isotracker manifest only has one person for now
[19:12] &lt;seb128&gt; unsure if that still makes sense to follow up since we are past LTS and we vote in favor of it
[19:13] &lt;seb128&gt; would still be nice to see that raised and changed if possible though
[19:13] &lt;seb128&gt; let's carry over, we can drop next time when Steve is around if needed

[00:03] &lt;JanC&gt; hm, but arm64 packages aren't on many (most?) mirrors, nor are they on e.g. security.ubuntu.com, just only on ports.ubuntu.com, why is that?
[00:04] &lt;JanC&gt; I remember 32-bit arm (armhf?) used to be on all the mirrors?
[00:10] &lt;JanC&gt; (I've seen there is also Ubuntu Pro for arm64, so the support should be okay, I guess :) )
[00:13] &lt;amurray&gt; hmm that is a good point re security.u.c - I wonder if we should consider having all the archs published there... I'll bring it up internally
[00:21] &lt;JanC&gt; I was also wondering about the availability of local mirrors (but maybe that's not a security question, except when the ports repos are not available for some reason?)
[00:24] &lt;blahdeblah&gt; It is a kind of weird look having official architectures only showing up on ports.u.c
[00:25] &lt;JanC&gt; yeah, it also used to be that architectures there didn't have full (LTS) support or the same priorities   :)
[00:38] &lt;JanC&gt; blahdeblah: especially as ports isn't mirrored on any mirror site I checked (both big local mirrors &amp; hosting company mirrors)
[02:18] &lt;blahdeblah&gt; JanC: Yep, exactly

[23:53] &lt;amurray&gt; JanC: can you be more specific? all architectures are supported equally in general, so arm64 has just as much security support as amd64

[08:27] &lt;KaiShiden&gt; Girls got chip planted without them knowing it!
[08:27] &lt;KaiShiden&gt; Some may say it kind of obscure conspiracy theory but, did you people ever heard of certain state (for example israel) with help of gay men cult or something stalking and abusing young girls, especially those who ever somehow got someone's attention for being lolita, nymphet, sexually curious or anything?
[08:27] &lt;KaiShiden&gt; I recently heard something like this, group or a cult stalk girls like this in pools, saunas clinics and fit centers and they plant something, possibly a tracking devices, virus capsulas or drugs and most of all chips under their skin?
[08:27] &lt;KaiShiden&gt; Buttocks, palms of hands and feets most of all?
[08:27] &lt;KaiShiden&gt; It leaves roundy red dot or a stripe on a skin people usually pay little to no attention.
[08:27] &lt;KaiShiden&gt; Some models have it too, for example https://www.xerotica.com/video/lovely-ginger-pleasures-her-lover-with-a-blowjob-before-he-slips-his-tool-deep-into-her-muff-51458.html or on a feet of this girl https://www.xerotica.com/video/captivating-dame-looks-fresh-as-she-shows-off-her-perky-tits-wihle-posing-in-the-bathroom-53737.html
[08:27] &lt;KaiShiden&gt; Also they keep stalking and abusing (and possibly killing) girls, who could fit the some criteria:
[08:27] &lt;KaiShiden&gt; 1. Who is or was lolita in ANY way.
[08:27] &lt;KaiShiden&gt; 2. Rhythmic gymnasts and possibly some other dance and sport practices.
[08:27] &lt;KaiShiden&gt; 3. Who's skinny just skinny, no time to check for driving license just plant her on, izhak! She dates pedos anyway.
[08:27] &lt;KaiShiden&gt; 4. Who's prominent member of certain pop culture communities (Sailor Moon for example) and
[08:27] &lt;KaiShiden&gt; 5. Who's anyhow may be described as follower of anything relatively close can be described as mother-goddess cult or cult of Isis goddes (aka Usha, Venus, Innana and so on...
[08:27] &lt;KaiShiden&gt; Sailor Moon is targeted as somewhat of modern representation of following mythology) if you suspect something or know anything write about it!
[08:27] &lt;KaiShiden&gt; 6. Daughters of those from groups above!
[08:27] &lt;KaiShiden&gt; inform inform inform!

[00:14] &lt;Unit193&gt; Debian confirmed/concluded that the one of the recent CVEs filed against tinyproxy is a duplicate of one already fixed in stable and in Ubuntu's LTS, https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1070395#12.  It'd be good if Ubuntu could mark CVE-2023-40533 as a duplicate of CVE-2022-40468 too.
[00:14] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- Debian bug 1070395 in src:tinyproxy "tinyproxy: CVE-2023-49606" [Grave, Fixed]
[00:14] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- ** REJECT ** This CVE ID is a duplicate of CVE-2022-40468 &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-40533&gt;
[00:14] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- Potential leak of left-over heap data if custom error page templates containing special non-standard variables are used. Tinyproxy commit 84f203f and earlier use uninitialized buffers in process_request() function. &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-40468&gt;
[00:14] &lt;Unit193&gt; Oh, hah.
[00:16] &lt;Unit193&gt; That still leaves CVE-2023-49606 open anyway, which is far more critical.
[00:16] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the HTTP Connection Headers parsing in Tinyproxy 1.11.1 and Tinyproxy 1.10.0. A specially crafted HTTP header can trigger reuse of previously freed memory, which leads to memory corruption and could lead to remote code execution. An attacker needs to make an unauthenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability. &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-49606&gt;

[14:30] &lt;slyon&gt; o/
[14:31] &lt;slyon&gt; With people being busy at the Canonical product sprint and the agenda looking fairly small, I propose skipping today's MIR meeting.
[14:31] &lt;sarnold&gt; works for me :)
[14:31] &lt;eslerm_&gt; sounds good to me :)
[14:31] &lt;slyon&gt; We have no MIR updates. And only one new (old) request in bug #1892456, which we cannot decide upon due to missing quorum

[14:32] &lt;slyon&gt; https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/component-mismatches-proposed.svg shows some desktop &amp; openstack cases for didrocks and jamespage to look into, but that's all normal and expected at the start of a cycle.
[14:33] &lt;slyon&gt; So see you all next time :) o/
[14:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; hah that svg is smaller than I expected
[14:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; or next week? :)
[14:34] &lt;eslerm_&gt; owning team is almost certainly Desktop, but needs to be stated in those
[14:34] &lt;eslerm_&gt; LP#1812456 is related

[15:02] &lt;juliank&gt; Most forgot so I guess um 5 minutes only today because not much to read
[15:03]  * juliank has blacked out a bit as to what happened this week
[15:04] &lt;juliank&gt; Holiday yesterday sure did not help
[15:04] &lt;bdrung&gt; lost all memory after first of May?
[15:04] &lt;juliank&gt; yeah
[15:06] &lt;juliank&gt; Questions, comments, additional memories recovered?
[15:07] &lt;bdrung&gt; Recovered memory: I worked on the sponsoring report generation.
[15:07] &lt;juliank&gt; When can we finally get https again for reports.qa.ubuntu.com? This is adding minutes of extra effort trying to convince firefox with https forced to downgrade
[15:07] &lt;dbungert&gt; mateus-morais: "are not Canonical owned" - I assume that should be "are now Canonical owned" ?
[15:08] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: you probably need to ask Brian to follow up on this
[15:08] &lt;mateus-morais&gt; dbungert: oops, yeah, fixing now, thanks!
[15:08] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon: yeah

[15:10] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon: I suppose we can delete src:software-properties-qt in oracular now, should be superseded by new binary software-properties-qt from software-properties
[15:10] &lt;vorlon&gt; sure, checking
[15:10] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2063094 so far we don't have actionable intel on, waiting for it to happen to me or tracking
[15:11] &lt;juliank&gt; ubottu: .
[15:11] &lt;juliank&gt; It dead
[15:11] &lt;juliank&gt; Oh I guess Launchpad is the one that is dead
[15:11] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: it's not superseded yet, software-properties 0.99.49 is still in -proposed
[15:11] &lt;juliank&gt; ah
[15:11] &lt;juliank&gt; let's try again

[15:13] &lt;vorlon&gt; should be fixed in the package popping the prompt, not worked around in u-r-u
[15:13] &lt;vorlon&gt; so decline
[15:13] &lt;juliank&gt; ah so if it is a new prompt we should not ask it on upgrades
[15:14] &lt;juliank&gt; launchpad is not responsive
[15:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; it is for me
[15:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; I've commented the bug and marked the u-r-u task wontfix
[15:15] &lt;juliank&gt; I think I marked it Invalid after that
[15:15] &lt;juliank&gt; But some loads take ages
[15:15] &lt;juliank&gt; Let me set it back
[15:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; oh ok.  also I lied I marked it invalid not wontfix ;)
[15:16] &lt;juliank&gt; heh
[15:16] &lt;juliank&gt; Anyway
[15:16] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2060326
[15:16] &lt;juliank&gt; See ubottu has trouble too
[15:16] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2060326
[15:16] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2060326
[15:16] &lt;juliank&gt; " unattended-upgrades is running forever "
[15:16] &lt;juliank&gt; probably a duplicate of Brian's bug
[15:17] &lt;vorlon&gt; NOW launchpad is unresponsive for me
[15:17] &lt;juliank&gt; oh sorry it says " unnattended upgrades stuck burning 100% cpu "
[15:17] &lt;vorlon&gt; we should take it
[15:18] &lt;vorlon&gt; and if we figure out it's a dupe, ok
[15:18] &lt;juliank&gt; I just mark it as a dupe, it quite clearly is one and we can dedup later
[15:18] &lt;juliank&gt; but we need to get needs information
[15:18] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok
[15:20] &lt;juliank&gt; mm has nothing new, just the desktop bugs

[15:20] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2058743 in systemd (Ubuntu) "systemd local DNS tests failing with timeout" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2058743
[15:20] &lt;xypron&gt; unattended-upgrades is really taking long time on embedded boards.
[15:20] &lt;juliank&gt; taking a long time != not finishing
[15:21] &lt;xypron&gt; hours
[15:21] &lt;juliank&gt; and we can relatively trivially make it a lot faster fwiw
[15:21] &lt;xypron&gt; I just dropped it for cron-apt running when I sleep.
[15:21] &lt;juliank&gt; We just don't use action groups right now, but neither do we use the new inhibit action group feature
[15:22] &lt;juliank&gt; i.e. a lot of time is spent after each mark_install() call for each upgradable package to figure out which packages are now autoremovable
[15:23] &lt;juliank&gt; The new API I need to expose then we can use it
[15:23] &lt;juliank&gt; or we just keep a continuous action group when we open the cache, though it might not be enough
[15:23] &lt;juliank&gt; (it has its own internal one?)
[15:23] &lt;juliank&gt; Anyway
[15:23] &lt;juliank&gt; systemd loocal dns tests failing
[15:23] &lt;juliank&gt; slyon was talking to smb on the bug
[15:24] &lt;juliank&gt; but nothing new there
[15:24] &lt;juliank&gt; And ff is empty so I suppose that wraps up bugs
[15:24] &lt;juliank&gt; I'll try to have a look at unattended-upgrades upstream status, the whole thing is weirdly still maintained by mvo
[15:25] &lt;juliank&gt; he released a 2.10 but it ftbfs

[15:25] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon: do migration or skip?
[15:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; we can do it
[15:26] &lt;juliank&gt; We can do grey items
[15:26] &lt;juliank&gt; :)
[15:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; oracular is open
[15:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; nah that's generally not a good use of time
[15:27] &lt;juliank&gt; well then fwupd-signed should be removed; nullboot I need to talk to gjolly if we can ship that for oracular now
[15:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; "should be removed" why?
[15:27] &lt;juliank&gt; and software-properties I guess needs retries
[15:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; (can do, just want to know the reason)
[15:27] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon: it was a wrongly uploaded rebuild of mine
[15:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok
[15:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; done
[15:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok so probably nothing to actually assign out here
[15:28] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon: So software-properties needs to be force-skiptested because it fails with software-properties-qt
[15:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; yeah, will hint

[14:37] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2054480 in nbd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] nbd-client" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[14:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, sarnold got to the shallow review we wanted
[14:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thakns
[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we won't add it to Noble based on that
[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but that means it is unblocked for 24.10 right?
[14:39] &lt;sarnold&gt; yes, or 24.04.1 ought to be fine, too
[14:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the required TODOs are still a few non-trivial tests
[14:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and consider adding confinement as recommended todo
[14:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; IIRC there were answers to that
[14:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; checking ...

[14:40] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2054480 in nbd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] nbd-client" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[14:40] &lt;sarnold&gt; confining all the things would be nice, yeah, but the primary use of nbd-client is likely during early boot with 'fixed' values .. the remote peer will be serving a filesystem, so very very powerful
[14:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes, the isolation is a "try to" ask
[14:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but the testing that was mentioned has not landed yet
[14:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think the order from here is
[14:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; 1. land the testing that they mentions
[14:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; 2. continue trying to confine if possible
[14:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; 3. SRU at least the testing
[14:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; actually 3. promoting in 24.10
[14:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; then SRU
[14:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and then consider promoting in 24.04.1

[14:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; nothing new
[14:45] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I added to my end-of-cycle comment
[14:45] &lt;waveform&gt; slyon, thanks -- I'll stick those on my todo list
[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I see
[14:45] &lt;eslerm_&gt; an issue from the late cycle request of qrtr/protection-domain-mapper is causing issues
[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the arm64 issues you mean?
[14:45] &lt;eslerm_&gt; yes
[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I wasn't even aware of those late additions
[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; oh that is the x13s story
[14:46] &lt;eslerm_&gt; they were a late ask in mantic
[14:46] &lt;sarnold&gt; I think xn_ox bought a new laptop :)
[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, it is a good "another example" to the problem overall
[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks eslerm_
[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; The action still didn't change
[14:46] &lt;eslerm_&gt; the packages looked dangerous, but were ack'd exculsively for x13s hardware enablement
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Hmm
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that adds the thought of "how to ensure limited acks stay limited"
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I have no great suggestion to make yet, need to ponder about that ...
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we all might need to, let me go on with the agenda for now
[14:47] &lt;eslerm_&gt; +1
[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic Any other business?
[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; oh and more feedback on the topic above
[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; you can be sure that I'll mention too huge too late changes in any 24.04 retrospective I'm in
[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; not sure it will change things, but it is the right thing to d
[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; o
[14:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; other than that - nothing MIR'ish from me or server in general
[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; are you thinking t64 or xz or boto?
[14:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; "or ..." and that is the problem
[14:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but more t64, crisis, ...
[14:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; huge things we could have done otherwise
[14:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; not so much xz and boto which just fell onto us
[14:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but that is opinion
[14:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; t64 really ought to have been done 22.10 or so
[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; if we could keep the things we control in -dev
[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that would help
[14:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; many things only happen when they become a crisis .. alas i'm guilty of this myself
[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah sarnold, exactly what you say
[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; anything else else?
[14:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; none here
[14:51] &lt;slyon&gt; nothing from my side
[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this is the last agenda item, so next would otherwise be closing
[14:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; except to idly wonder what the next t64 is :)
[14:51] &lt;eslerm_&gt; none for me
[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: that is for a talk at beer'o'clock - not for this meeting
[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, thank you all

[15:49] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; sil2100, kanashiro, teward: hey! are you all available to join the meeting in 15?
[15:49] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; fwiw, Brian, Seb, and Robie are out today and won't make it.
[15:49] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; as a result, we won't be quorate
[15:50] &lt;sil2100&gt; Yeah, I'm here
[15:52] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; sil2100: do we still have the meeting per usual?
[15:52] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; or should we defer the applicant to the next one? :(
[15:54] &lt;teward&gt; *burps* yes utkarsh2102
[15:55] &lt;teward&gt; but if we dont have quorum we can still meet ask questions and then defer to ML for vote. Up to you what we do
[15:55] &lt;teward&gt; we can defer to next meeting for applicant or have our meeting but have final vote on ML or such
[15:55] &lt;teward&gt; i'm not against deferring though
[15:55] &lt;teward&gt; weird ass monday @ work today
[15:56] &lt;bandali&gt; wouldn't 4/7 be quorum?
[15:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; o/
[15:57] &lt;teward&gt; i see a robie
[15:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; What's desktop-core and desktop-extra?
[15:58] &lt;teward&gt; rbasak: think you meant that for -devel
[15:58] &lt;teward&gt; rbasak: AFAIK desktop-core is the base install and -extra is all the extras like libreoffice, etc. selected @ install time
[15:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; No it's in relation to the upcoming application meeting
[15:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; These are packagesets
[15:58] &lt;teward&gt; ah check
[15:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; But I don't understand why they exist or what they're used for
[15:59] &lt;teward&gt; rbasak: sounds like a question we have to bug foundations or desktop team about i'm just guessing
[15:59] &lt;teward&gt; we have packageset lists lying around somewhere right
[16:00] &lt;teward&gt; i forgot where we keep those lists :/
[16:00] &lt;teward&gt; (computer resets are evil)
[16:00] &lt;bandali&gt; i'm not sure about the reaosn for distinction between ubuntu-desktop and desktop-core, but the Description of desktop-extra is clarifying: https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/packagesets/noble/desktop-extra
[16:00] &lt;bandali&gt; Description: Every package that is NOT in ubuntu-desktop, desktop-core or core, but needed for a vanilla GNOME.
[16:01] &lt;teward&gt; i wonder if core is the minimal default insyall
[16:02] &lt;teward&gt; install stuff*
[16:02] &lt;teward&gt; and Desktop is the full software set
[16:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; What I'm wondering is why most of the required packages here aren't in ubuntu-desktop already.
[16:02] &lt;teward&gt; rbasak:  unless -core and -desktop are both based on the metapackages (which would make little sense for uploads)
[16:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; okay, let me officially start the meeting?
[16:03] &lt;rbasak&gt; Please. Thanks!
[16:03] &lt;teward&gt; unless Desktop has different requirements in their teams for upload to different segments and such
[16:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; sil2100, kanashiro?

[16:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: hello! can you please introduce yourself?
[16:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; meanwhile we all go through your application page?
[16:05] &lt;bandali&gt; hi utkarsh2102 :) sure
[16:07] &lt;bandali&gt; i'm Amin Bandali, and i've been part of Canonical's Ubuntu Desktop team since Nov 2022. i'm primarily the maintainer of Ubuntu's Firefox packages, but i also work on various other aspects of the Ubuntu Desktop, and i've also worked on other areas of Ubuntu in general, both via my kind sponsors and indirectly as a Debian Developer
[16:07] &lt;rbasak&gt; Hi!
[16:07] &lt;bandali&gt; hi! o/
[16:07] &lt;rbasak&gt; " Becoming a core-dev would allow me to upload all kinds of desktop-related packages across the Ubuntu archive, not just the subset I have access to as a member of ~ubuntu-desktop (which excludes most packages in the desktop-core set)."
[16:08] &lt;rbasak&gt; As above, I'm puzzled by this. Why aren't desktop-related packages that you need to upload as part of desktop work already the ubuntu-desktop packageset?
[16:08] &lt;rbasak&gt; (maybe not really a question for you)
[16:08] &lt;rbasak&gt; I ask because if we fixed that, surely that would help more people than just you?
[16:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; Perhaps there are some packages that shouldn't belong in ubuntu-desktop for which you getting core dev privileges would help, but I'm unclear on what those are.
[16:09] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; also, I note that there are endorsements from people who are not Ubuntu members/MOTU/core dev. Can they still endorse? I'd expect them to be in the "Comments" section.
[16:09] &lt;bandali&gt; right, that's a great question but unfortunately i don't have the historical background (i wish Seb was here today). but i know it goes back at least 4 years, and most likely many more years before that
[16:09] &lt;teward&gt; i have a followup on that, why do you need coredev if instead you could apply for the specific packagesets
[16:09] &lt;teward&gt; (even if we didnt consolidate all the desktop pkgsets today)
[16:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; Could you perhaps elaborate on exactly which packages you would like to upload, and which of those packages you have had sponsored, that do not belong in the ubuntu-desktop packageset?
[16:09] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; if so, then only two core-devs which are both in ~Desktop. Are there people who you've worked outside ~Desktop?
[16:10] &lt;bandali&gt; i'm applying for core-dev in part because i don't *only* work on desktop packages
[16:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; i don't *only* work on desktop packages&gt; OK - could you elaborate then please on exactly which packages we're talking about?
[16:12] &lt;bandali&gt; being a DD, i work on packages across the Debian archives (e.g. i maintain jami, opendht, restinio, etc.)
[16:12] &lt;bandali&gt; i believe there a number of exampels of non-desktop packages i've worked on on my application page, if you search for 'non-desktop'
[16:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK but I don't see any sponsored uploads of those packages into Ubuntu.
[16:13] &lt;teward&gt; ^^ that
[16:13] &lt;bandali&gt; how about poppler?
[16:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; We should certainly consider PPU for the packages that you maintain in Debian
[16:14] &lt;bandali&gt; i also do +1 rotations every now and again, and being able to upload those directly would be great
[16:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; For a core dev application, I'd like to start by seeing your track record of sponsorship in Ubuntu for the packages that you are looking to upload. To be clear, I'm not saying that there's a hard requirement to have these, but I'd like to understand where you are and that's usually my starting point, and I'm struggling to identify the subset of your sponsored uploads that relate to this application.
[16:15] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I was wondering if a path like packageset -&gt; MOTU -&gt; core-dev would be good. So essentially, MOTU being the next target?
[16:15] &lt;bandali&gt; it so happens that for my last +1 shift i was able to do all of my work directly in Debian, but being able to do that work directly in Ubuntu would be nice
[16:15] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; re: +1 work^
[16:16] &lt;bandali&gt; i did initially consider MOTU first, but thought it might be good to skip directly to core-dev since i've worked on a number of non-desktop main packages like poppler etc. that aren't in universe and so not addressed by motu
[16:17] &lt;bandali&gt; and thought that my background and experience as a DD would have provided me with the skills to aim directly for core-dev
[16:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; I realise that poppler isn't strictly desktop since I suppose it can be used usefully in a server environment, but it does still feel desktop-y. Has it been considered for the ubuntu-desktop packageset?
[16:18] &lt;bandali&gt; not that i know of, i'd defer to Seb to clarify that
[16:19] &lt;bandali&gt; (also, to be clear, this is the part of the page i was referring to earlier: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/bandali/core-dev-application#non-desktop )
[16:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; Did you take that from the sponsorship miner / udd? I'm looking the miner results at https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi?render=html&amp;sponsor=&amp;sponsor_search=name&amp;sponsoree=*bandali*&amp;sponsoree_search=name and it seems a bit messed up :-(
[16:21] &lt;bandali&gt; err yes i think so
[16:21] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I was gonna get to that, too :)
[16:21] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; there seems to be a mismatch
[16:21] &lt;bandali&gt; yeah e.g. some of that aren't SRUs
[16:21] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; a lot of those uploads are uploads to Debian
[16:21] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; and a sync here
[16:22] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; that's why some won't show up in UDD
[16:22] &lt;bandali&gt; sorry i probably should've cleaned that up beforehand. in my defence i wasn't sure if there would be a meeting today..
[16:23] &lt;teward&gt; bandali: it's always best to **assume there will be a meeting** if you've placed yourself in the agenda
[16:23] &lt;teward&gt; because otherwise you arrive here unprepared
[16:23] &lt;bandali&gt; teward, that's what i assumed the last times it didn't happen :)
[16:23] &lt;bandali&gt; but ack
[16:25] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: I see almost all uploads by Jeremy and some by Seb. Whilst that's not a problem, I am wondering if you have worked with core-devs outside ~Desktop?
[16:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; Do you have any SRU experience for regular bugfixes?
[16:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; I only see https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtk4/4.12.3+ds-1ubuntu0.1 which looks like an upstream point release. Are there any other SRUs you've had sponsored?
[16:26] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, yes indeed, just about all my uploads to Ubuntu have been sponsored by Jeremy and Seb
[16:26] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, i believe i had several more. lemme see if i can find them quickly
[16:28] &lt;sil2100&gt; bandali: related to rbasak's question: what do you need to consider when preparing for an SRU upload? What can be uploaded as an SRU, what is the process and how to make it land in a stable series?
[16:28] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; and on that note, I had a question.What if a package X is on version 1.2.3-1 in Focal and 1.2.4-1 in Mantic, Jammy, Noble, and devel (Oracular now). And there's a bug you'd like to fix for X at least for Focal, what will be the next steps?
[16:28] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, e.g. there's this nautilus one https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/1:42.6-0ubuntu1 but as a component of GNOME core, it has a micro-release exception
[16:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm really looking for "regular" ones please
[16:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; (since they exercise the SRU process much more compleely - do you have experience of doing that?)
[16:30] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I have more questions, but I'll let you get the above ones squared away first :)
[16:30] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, i recall doing some but i'm afraid i don't have a link handy at this moment. i'll let you know if i can find though
[16:30] &lt;bandali&gt; sil2100, typing my answer to your question now
[16:30] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; :(
[16:30] &lt;sil2100&gt; Thank you! :)
[16:32] &lt;bandali&gt; sil2100, generally speaking, SRUs should only contain bug fixes and no new features. the procedure is described on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates, including a sample template for the accompanying bug that needs to be filed on LP to explain the rationale for the SRU, its potential impact on users, and the bug(s) it aims to fix and how that can be validated (that it indeed fixes though
[16:32] &lt;bandali&gt; bugs)
[16:32] &lt;bandali&gt; (also including a test plan for testing and validation of the fix, of course)
[16:33] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, typing an answer to your question now
[16:35] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, generally the fix should also be prepared for all affected later Ubuntu releases as well, so that upgrading to newer releases wouldn't cause a regression again
[16:35] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: okay, thanks, what versions would you use for each releases, then?
[16:37] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, the versions of X would have to be crafted in a way to ensure that they are in increasing order from one Ubuntu release to the next, so that apt would correctly pick it up as an upgrade
[16:37] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; yes, can you give me exact versions please?
[16:37] &lt;sil2100&gt; bandali: thanks. And once the SRU gets accepted into -proposed, what does the uploader need to do? What are their responsibilities? When will the update be made avilable to the users?
[16:38] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, e.g. 1.2.3-1ubuntu1 in focal, perhaps 1.2.3-2ubuntu1 in jammy, and 1.2.4-1ubuntu in mantic
[16:40] &lt;bandali&gt; sil2100, the uploader would then do validation on the -proposed upload to verify that the indeed fixes all the bugs it claims to have fixed and introduced no regressions. then mark the bug as verification-done-$rel
[16:41] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I am afraid that's not quite correct :(
[16:41] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdatePreparation :)
[16:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; bandali: the uploader would then do validation&gt; specifically, what would be considered an acceptable level of validation, and what would not? At that stage in the process, how could the uploader be sure that the validation they're performing will be considered acceptable by the SRU team?
[16:42] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, ack
[16:42] &lt;bandali&gt; sil2100, once verified, the upload would then be released to users via -updates, potentially with phasing and monitoring that e.g. there are indeed no increased crash rates
[16:44] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, the details would vary from one case to the next, but i believe at minimum the uploader would need to exercise the agreed upon test plan for the package being updated
[16:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. And if, after an SRU you prepared is released, you discover that it resulted in a serious regression, what should you do?
[16:45] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; re: +1 maint: once you've uploaded a package to the devel release, is there something else you should be doing?
[16:47] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, if it's still in phasing, the phasing should be halted and a new SRU with the fix prepared. if it's ineed a serious/critical regression, one would need to prepare a new stop-gap upload effectively rolling the package back to previous version, while another upload could be prepared
[16:48] &lt;rbasak&gt; bandali: OK, but what's the process to arrange these things?
[16:49] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, generally, i'd check if the devel upload contains fixes potentially relevant to existing stable releases and if so, prepare an SRU.  i'd also check if my fix for Ubuntu could be applied upstream in Debian, or perhaps even better, directly to the main upstream project, and forward my patch(es) to them accordingly. if that's not quite the answer you were looking for, would you please
[16:49] &lt;bandali&gt; clarify?
[16:51] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, as in, e.g. what version to use for an upload of the previous working version?
[16:53] &lt;rbasak&gt; bandali: sorry no that's not what I'm asking. Imagine you've just heard about this serious regression and Jeremy and Seb are unavailable. As a core dev, your team is looking to you to sort things out. What's the established process to alert the SRU team?
[16:54] &lt;rbasak&gt; You may understand that the SRU team will stop phasing and/or urgently review your revert upload, but how is it that you will get their attention to do this?
[16:55] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: my question is limited to the devel release you may upload to, once the upload is done, where does it go? what next steps you might want to work on to ensure the entire work's done?
[16:56] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, for contacting the SRU team, i'd check https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Contacting_the_SRU_team to see who is on rotation that day, and ping them in #ubuntu-release or directly to draw their attention to the matter
[16:57] &lt;teward&gt; fyi guys I have a hard-stop in 3 minutes
[16:58] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; okay, I'll start to push this faster
[16:58] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, oh, thanks for the clarification. normally, the upload to devel would land immediately. but that won't be the case e.g. during one of the devel freezes (where the package would land in -proposed) or if the package is NEW
[16:58] &lt;bandali&gt; and would need to be manually reviewed and approved by an AA
[16:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not sure we can conclude today :-(
[16:59] &lt;teward&gt; rbasak: i don't think we can either, but feel free to continue the meeting
[16:59] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: if I am not mistaken, the upload to devel don't just land to the -release pocket immediately.
[16:59] &lt;teward&gt; just poke me when you need a vote
[16:59] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; it goes to -proposed and then to -release subsequently
[16:59] &lt;teward&gt; (I won't be able to do much else here at that point though, I already have my info I need for a vote)
[17:00] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, oh? i thought they only went through -proposed e.g. during freezes, but sorry if i got that wrong
[17:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; do you know what's the process for an upload to move from -proposed to -release
[17:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; teward: if you have your vote ready, can I proxy that if we conclude in a bit?
[17:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; you could perhaps DM me and I can comment on your behald
[17:00] &lt;teward&gt; utkarsh2102: i'll just leave it in paste so you can say "please vote" with a ping to me and i'll hit enter
[17:01] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; teward: works perfectly for me
[17:01] &lt;bandali&gt; not sure off top my head, i'm afraid. but i'd imagine a member of ubuntu-release would shepherd it through?
[17:01] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: I am afraid not, it's the duty of the uploader to shepherd it
[17:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; and only contact the release team when you've tried all the obvious things that are blocking the migration
[17:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK I was somewhere between "more information would help me vote" and "I think we have some more adminstrative matters to resolve first". But I'm afraid your answers continue to give me concern and so I'm a hard -1 now, and I don't see any point in dragging this on further.
[17:02] &lt;bandali&gt; ack
[17:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; ok, are we ready to vote in that case?
[17:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; I've been writing up more specifics to give you some guidance on what to work on here. I'll continue doing that. I'll be a few minutes.
[17:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration/. That's what I was looking for.
[17:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; the first point "Migrating packages from -proposed to release"
[17:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; anyway, sil2100: okay to vote?
[17:03] &lt;sil2100&gt; Yes
[17:03] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, ah, yes of course. sorry

I encourage bandali to continue to review and learn the processes and do some uploads with extra sponsors and support and then at some point in the future apply again.

[17:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Regressions - what probably rbasak was looking for). Anyway, I think it'd be helpful to work with a core-dev for a bit and get clarity on these processes and I'd also recommend getting more sponsorships from people outside ~Desktop. I'd also recommend going via MOTU, et al. This helps in inspiring some

[17:08] &lt;bandali&gt; thanks all for your feedback and time
[17:08] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I am sorry that the vote didn't go in favor. But I think we have some good feedback to work through and apply once again once you and your sponsors think it's time again! o/
[17:08] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I think Robie is still finishing up his feedback..
[17:08] &lt;rbasak&gt; Yes
[17:09] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: don't hesitate in asking DMB for help if you're ever stuck or need some advice or review, et al. ML is the best way if you'd like to reach us.
[17:10] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I am also happy to help with some sponsorship provided my capacity! o/
[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; Here's some specifc feedback:
[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; 1) I'd like clarity on what exactly you're looking to unblock by getting core dev privileges, and then a clear track record of sponsorship for those specific things. Right now I'm very unclear on this and this hampers me from objectively considering your application. If you already have a suitable track record, there's no reason to wait - we can just see it as an admistrative matter to help us
[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; better assess your existing application.
[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; 2) SRU knowledge and experience: I'd like to see experience of "regular" SRUs but so far I haven't seen anything apart from a couple of microrelease updates which follow a slightly different process. If you already have a suitable track record, there's no reason to wait - we can just see it as an admistrative matter to help us better assess your existing application. However, some of your
[17:10] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #action Utkarsh to send out a follow-up mail on the ML
[17:10] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: Utkarsh to send out a follow-up mail on the ML
[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; SRU-relted answers missed the mark (eg. on versions and on flagging regressions). I feel that you should know these better - the answers are documented, or you improve your answers through experience.
[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; 3) Proposed migration. "i thought they only went through -proposed e.g. during freezes, but sorry if i got that wrong". This is indeed wrong, and I think a hard requirement for any core dev to understand. I'm also confused on how you achieved doing +1 maintenance without this knowledge. This suggests to me that you're assuming incorrect things about Ubuntu from your knowledge of Debian without
[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; appreciating the key points on how our development processes differ. Please continue learning this.
[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; 4) That you worked on the poppler transition is good but looking at the actual uploads it's not clear to me if your contribution was driving the transition and that you understood the whole process, given your answer about proposed migration above. We didn't get to discussing this.
[17:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; 5) The above list isn't exhaustive - we ran out of time to discuss further. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RobieBasak/DMB/CoreDev for my opinion and what I expect you to know.
[17:11] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; that's phenomenal advice, Robie. Thanks! o/
[17:11] &lt;bandali&gt; thank you indeed for your detailed reply/feedback Robie, appreciate it
[17:11] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; since we're overtime, I'll stop here formally and end the meeting..

[17:12] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; ok, it's 10:40 PMÂ  here and I should run and have some food. Bye. o/
[17:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks. Please do reach out if anything is unclear, and/or if you'd like to go through my expectations before re-applying. I'd really like you fly through next time - your actual technical ability looks great and would be valuable for us to have!
[17:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; But the Ubuntu-specific stuff needs more clarity I think.
[17:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; I hope the above feedback is clear enough. I don't consider it acceptable to give anyone a -1 without clear and specific feedback, but I did have to write it in a hurry. Please let me know if anything doesn't make sense.
[17:14] &lt;bandali&gt; looking back, i believe i knew the correct answer to at least two of the above questions. not sure what came over me and i fully blanked on them...
[17:15] &lt;bandali&gt; your feedback makes a lot of sense, and once again is very much appreciated. i'll take it to heart and know better, and work on what needs improving
[17:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; I appreciate that it's difficult in realtime and individuals perform very differently in this very unrealistic situation. That's why I want a good track record, but we seemed to be missing that too :-/
[17:15] &lt;bandali&gt; ack
[17:16] &lt;rbasak&gt; For example if you had (for example, this isn't a hard requirement) five excellent SRUs with everything correct already recorded in comments in bugs, then I wouldn't have asked hard questions :)
[17:17] &lt;bandali&gt; :) right

[04:58] &lt;luna_&gt; morning
[06:08] &lt;primalpimmy&gt; Hello, I have a question related to apparmor. So basically I have a k8s pod that has a host mount to /etc/apparmor.d , and that pod is responsible for generating and enforcing profiles using "apparmor_parser" from within, and then it gets enforced on the host. But for some reason the profile seems to block pods that tries to access the K8s API.  
[06:08] &lt;primalpimmy&gt; even though all network is allowed in the profile 
[06:08] &lt;primalpimmy&gt; type=AVC msg=audit(1713956546.682:24729): apparmor="DENIED" operation="create" profile="kubearmor-default" pid=41265 comm="kubearmor" family="inet" sock_type="stream" protocol=0 requested_mask="create" denied_mask="create"
[06:10] &lt;primalpimmy&gt; to fix this, I again have to run "apparmor_parser" on the host instead of inside that pod, and now it works as it should.
[07:02] &lt;mcphail&gt; https://ubuntu.com//blog/whats-new-in-security-for-ubuntu-24-04-lts - thanks for this post, amurray . Is the unprivileged namespace hardening the reason why I can't run docker in a nesting-enabled lxc or lxd container using the noble nightlies? Is there a way around that, if that's the case?
[19:40] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: sarnold: because it came up on Ask Ubuntu (https://askubuntu.com/questions/1511606/pci-audit-openssh-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-cve-2023-51767), I'm poking regarding CVE-2023-51767.  Is only openssh-ssh1 affected?  Or are all openssh servers (and yes it's possible to enforce newer SSH versions if I remember right!) impacted?  The question came up because of PCI/DSS compliance.
[19:40] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- OpenSSH through 9.6, when common types of DRAM are used, might allow row hammer attacks (for authentication bypass) because the integer value of authenticated in mm_answer_authpassword does not resist flips of a single bit. NOTE: this is applicable to a certain threat model of attacker-victim co-location in which the attacker has user privileges. &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-51767&gt;
[19:59] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: could we also annotate the bug with https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3656 which states this: "This attack was not demonstrated against stock OpenSSH, but instead against a modified sshd that had extra synchronisation added to make the attack easier. AFAIK achieving the timing required to successfully exploit is close to impossible in the real world. See section 9 of their paper 
[19:59] &lt;teward&gt; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02545.pdf They don't mention it, but any kind of ASLR would increase the difficulty of attack by several orders of magnitude. Nobody has demonstrated this attack against a configuration remotely approximating real-world conditions. We consider rowhammer mitigation to the job of the platform, not userspace software."
[19:59] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- bugzilla.mindrot.org bug 3656 in Portable OpenSSH "How to fix row hammer attacksï¼" [Security, New]
[19:59] &lt;teward&gt; s/annotate the bug/annotate the CVE/
[20:00] &lt;teward&gt; because it looks like the paper on this exploit is not possible in Real World Implementations
[20:04] &lt;JanC&gt; so basically this is only relevant if you still use Ubuntu from before 2005?
[20:05] &lt;teward&gt; JanC: from what i'm reading even latest OpenSSH in 24.04 is impacted, but upon additional diving into the linked CVE and its papers on arxiv and other documentation, it requires very specific circumstances to happen
[20:06] &lt;teward&gt; and by very specific I mean modified sshd and a configuration that wouldn't be sane in the real world
[20:10] &lt;JanC&gt; and when people change their sshd that's not Ubuntu's responsibility
[20:11] &lt;teward&gt; correct
[20:11] &lt;JanC&gt; also, I'd expect this to be mostly a problem on servers, but those would use ECC in most cases...
[20:12] &lt;teward&gt; the core problem however is PCI/DSS compliance scans are stupid and don't take into account when these CVEs have very VERY specific *theoretical only* cases of exploit
[20:12] &lt;teward&gt; hence the only reason i'm poking xD
[20:12] &lt;JanC&gt; and I think ECC would prevent this exploit too?
[20:14] &lt;JanC&gt; or at least make it much harder too
[20:14] &lt;teward&gt; yeah that's the point any kind of implementation of ASLR makes it difficult, and Linux has had that since 2005 so
[20:15] &lt;teward&gt; it makes it several orders of magnitude more difficult, and there's no real-world conditions approximated config nor stock OpenSSH confirmed affected by this, especially when we dig into the paper
[20:15] &lt;teward&gt; this CVE probably should've been marked as an experimental or theory-only case and not a CVCSS 7.0 IMO
[20:18] &lt;sdeziel&gt; the paper specifically calls out that ECC isn't a good defense: `in 2019 showed that the ECC countermeasure is not secure either`
[20:20] &lt;JanC&gt; it might not be a full defence, but if your system suddenly gets a million ECC errors that would probably make the admins suspicious?  :)
[20:27] &lt;sdeziel&gt; JanC: yeah that's also my understanding, I just wanted to mention that's no silver bullet unfortunately. HW is hard (too) it seems :)
[20:53] &lt;teward&gt; sdeziel: we also have to keep in mind that there's a lot of mitigations that just *naturally* work and sane defaults tend to mitigate the risk by orders of magnitude
[20:54] &lt;teward&gt; so default kernel ASLR and such, sane configis for a real-world setup, etc. seem to be the proper mitigations, and nobody's proposed or shown a *real world* usable exploit that isn't a shared-neighbor type local-only attack vector with user creds
[20:58] &lt;sdeziel&gt; teward: I didn't read the paper but a quick look at it showed it talks about password auth which is indeed not a sane config
[20:58] &lt;teward&gt; yeah i glanced it
[21:06] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; teward: sure, I'll add the upstream bug to it tomorrow
[21:07] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: thank you kindly
[21:07] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; btw, pretty much everything is vulnerable to rowhammer issues and there's nothing we can do about it except stop using computers
[21:07] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; every year someone comes out with a new practical attack
[21:07] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: true. the problem is PCI/DSS compliance checks flag that as a problem
[21:07] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; that isn't my problem :)
[21:07] &lt;teward&gt; despite veryone KNOWING rowhammer is still a vulnerability
[21:07] &lt;teward&gt; nope
[21:08] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; I will add more details to the CVE tomorrow, I'll take another look at it
[21:08] &lt;teward&gt; but as long as we annotate the bug with notes, etc. so people can JUSTIFY why it can't be fixed (there is no solution for rowhammer attacks!) things're better
[21:08] &lt;teward&gt; cool cool mdeslaur thanks,

[14:35] &lt;sarnold&gt; slyon: aye :( it's beena  busy week. last time around I forgot this, time around around I deprioritized it :(
[14:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ack to have this early in 24.10
[14:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: understandable, and now the ship has sailed - so take your time

[14:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; do not be sad!

[14:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues
[14:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; two newer cases worth to discuss
[14:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/54
[14:36] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Issue 54 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "Remove libgoa from the upstream redflags" [Open]
[14:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; +1 from me as well
[14:36] &lt;slyon&gt; +1 for dropping the libgoa-* restriction!
[14:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; any objections, maybe we miss why it was excluded
[14:37] &lt;slyon&gt; This is related to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/msgraph/+bug/2060035
[14:37] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2060035 in msgraph (Ubuntu) "[MIR] msgraph" [Undecided, Fix Released]
[14:37] &lt;didrocks&gt; +1 too
[14:37] &lt;sarnold&gt; it's funny, I had the impression goa overall was deprecated or similar?
[14:38] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I have not looked into libgoa deeply. It sounds reasonable due to webkit removal, but extra attention around oauth2 sounds useful as well
[14:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; would that extra attention need effort?
[14:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; or is it just a benefit of the new goa handling it that way?
[14:40] &lt;eslerm_&gt; it is certainly a much better scenario than including webkit
[14:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, then I think I'll land a change as requested
[14:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks for the discussion
[14:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Next is an absolutely valid complain https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/55
[14:41] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Issue 55 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "end-of-cycle unexpected changes" [Open]
[14:41] &lt;sarnold&gt; +441 -1334  :D :D :D
[14:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hehe @sarnold
[14:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; was that a rush - yes
[14:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but no one had better options
[14:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Instead of just shrudding I usually aim for lessons learned and improvements
[14:42] &lt;sarnold&gt; indeed, what I'm hoping to come of this is perhaps an idea of how some automation could be built to help us find cases half-way through a cycle
[14:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; In this particular case i can tell you that the reason for it was a loss of ownership between 4 teams
[14:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and the fix is also already clear, we have concluded who owns it (will be CPC) properly and that will be in place in a bit
[14:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; working with Eric on this
[14:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the other outcome is something along the suggestion of sarnold
[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; how to detect "unmaintained" earlier/better
[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but just to mention, this was known to be unmaintained - yet it fell into the responsibility cracks
[14:43] &lt;didrocks&gt; I would put unmaintained equating multiple owners, which ends up to no owners
[14:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; didrocks: exactly
[14:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; didrocks: at least the chance of behaving that way
[14:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; does anyone have code to check project health in a sane way this could be built upon?
[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Hmm
[14:45] &lt;sarnold&gt; in some sense there's probably too many "project health" metrics that exist and could be used, and none probably has enough signal to noise
[14:45] &lt;didrocks&gt; nothing comes to mind, I think this task needs a proper owner (pun intended) with research to provide metrics + ubuntu specifity and so onâ¦
[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; This might be a step in the release process
[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; like Release -x weeks
[14:45] &lt;sarnold&gt; didrocks: lol :)
[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; check all your subscribed packages if they are maintainable
[14:46] &lt;didrocks&gt; maybe a first easy step is how long since the last package update?
[14:46] &lt;didrocks&gt; not a very good metric, but sounds an easy one enough (we need to exclude pure rebuild-only upload though)
[14:46] &lt;didrocks&gt; that would mean some maintainance, but a random definition of "some" :)
[14:47] &lt;sarnold&gt; how long since a new upstream release?
=== ahasenack_ is now known as ahasenack
[14:47] &lt;slyon&gt; There's the Canonical spec CT002, which might help with that..
[14:48] &lt;slyon&gt; "CT002 - Supply Chain Community Analytics"
[14:48] &lt;sarnold&gt; heh :( the search function doesn't find find it via 'ct002' or 'suppl'
[14:48] &lt;didrocks&gt; (I donât have access to it)
[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; .. and the site lacks the usual 'report a bug on this site' -- who owns this site to report a bug that it lacks a bug report link? :)
[14:49] &lt;slyon&gt; https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUrHVI-EIC7vJ4QmOkr_SoJX7b4ykSyoxVffGPwgLBw &lt;- Canonical employees should be able to access this
[14:49] &lt;didrocks&gt; sarnold: heh :)
[14:50] &lt;didrocks&gt; thanks slyon
[14:50] &lt;jbicha&gt; sarnold: GNOME devs seem a bit meh about GNOME Online Accounts in a world with lots of sandboxed apps; I think UOA may have had a better architecture for that. But meanwhile GOA is still useful for the base desktop
[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Updating the issue
[14:51] &lt;slyon&gt; I think they are planing some recurring porject health checks, which we might be able to rely upon
[14:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; jbicha: hmm, I hadn't thought about sandboxing here.. I can see why that would influence their thinking. but if it's not explicitly dead, yay.
[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; updated the case, it will stay open until there is an owner to work on the tooling and/or the discussion to get it into the release process
[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks for the input on GOA jbicha
[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; going on in the agenda

[14:56] &lt;slyon&gt; nothign
[14:56] &lt;sarnold&gt; thanks for making this the smoothest lts cycle that I remember
[14:57] &lt;slyon&gt; do I hear sarcasm there? Or does it just relate to the MIR process?
[14:57] &lt;didrocks&gt; I really appreciate how the security part is now predictable and working well!
[14:58] &lt;sarnold&gt; it took a lot of concerted work from a lot of people to prune dependencies, work with upstreams, and figure out how to get things done predictably
[14:58] &lt;didrocks&gt; on the smooth part, I would say at least for me that the MIR part woud qualify as such :)
[14:58] &lt;didrocks&gt; would*
[14:58] &lt;sarnold&gt; slyon: the MIR process -- xz was  a thing, but you and vorlon and crew managed to keep us on schedule all the same
[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah
[14:59] &lt;slyon&gt; indeed, MIRs were mostly well planned and executed this cycle!
[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that thanks I definetly share
[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; in the past MIR process weird, Release easy - now the inverse :-)
[14:59] &lt;eslerm_&gt; thanks everyone :)
[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'll call the meeting done with these nice words
[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; onto another good cycle (for the things we can influence)
[15:00] &lt;sarnold&gt; :)

[19:01] &lt;seb128&gt; https://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2024/04/09/%23ubuntu-meeting.html
[19:01] &lt;seb128&gt; "Next chair will be vorlon, with sil2100 as backup"
[19:01] &lt;seb128&gt; Steve sent apologies
[19:02] &lt;seb128&gt; I expect Lukasz is busy on release week but he didn't decline/send an email, let me ping him
[19:02] &lt;seb128&gt; Robie declined the calendar invite
[19:04] &lt;seb128&gt; amurray, Lukasz doesn't seem to be online...
[19:04] &lt;seb128&gt; it's not really surprising that on release week that people are busy with other things
[19:05] &lt;seb128&gt; amurray, should we just skip that one?
[19:05] &lt;amurray&gt; yeah, fair enough
[19:06] &lt;seb128&gt; alright, I will update the wiki with the content with the previous meeting and bump the next meeting date / keep the chairs
[19:06] &lt;amurray&gt; also the next one is scheduled during the product roadmap - so I assume we'll skip that too and so next TB meeting would be 21st may
[19:06] &lt;seb128&gt; amurray, thanks and have a nice day!
[19:06] &lt;seb128&gt; ah, fair comment, I will do that directly and email the list about  it

[15:06] &lt;waveform&gt; slyon, at least the last version I tested was, but I saw there's now ~ppa7 in there? Has the fundamental logic changed (i.e. is re-testing needed?)
[15:06] &lt;bdrung&gt; bdmurray, in the unapproved queue!
[15:06] &lt;enr0n&gt; slyon: thanks for all of your wait-online work \o/
[15:07] &lt;slyon&gt; waveform: ~ppa1 was from PR#455 (different logic), ~ppa2++ is fundamentally the same logic from PR#456

[14:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; actually almost everyone said hi already
[14:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; let us start
[14:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic current component mismatches
[14:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams

[14:32] &lt;aciba&gt; O/
[14:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; first trace-cmd and libtraceevent
[14:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; trace-cmd ready
[14:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; libtraceevent ready as well
[14:33] &lt;slyon&gt; I think those are ready, but pending libtracefs, which still sees some tests issues on s390x &amp; ppc64el
[14:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; can be promoted
[14:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; any opposing opinions?
[14:33] &lt;slyon&gt; would it be OK to skip those architectures?
[14:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I was going by the "all required TODOs" - thanks for reminding me
[14:34] &lt;slyon&gt; +1 for promoting trace-cmd + libtraceevent already. That would reduce the component mismatches already
[14:34] &lt;sarnold&gt; are we suggesting to leave them buggy or change the arch: lines to remove those buggy arches?
[14:34] &lt;slyon&gt; it's already a mismatch, so .. meh
[14:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we do not really promote just some arches
[14:34] &lt;slyon&gt; I do not mean in promotion, but in the MIR test requirements
[14:34] &lt;slyon&gt; cc adrien
[14:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm failing to find the test issues in the logs that are linked on libtracefs
[14:38] &lt;dviererbe&gt; o/
[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think if we not build this for ppc64 and s390x IBM and IBM users would be rather unhappy
[14:38] &lt;sarnold&gt; hi dviererbe
[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the question is can it be fixed later
[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; or not
[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; is there new insight in that?
[14:38] &lt;slyon&gt; IMO we should still build it, but just accept ppc64el and s390x autopkgtest failing (for now) â to be fixed later
[14:39] &lt;slyon&gt; at least now we know that it's broken on ppc64el and s390x, whereas before (without tests) it was just broken
[14:39] &lt;sarnold&gt; https://autopkgtest.ubuntu.com/packages/libtracefs -- some fails here?
[14:40] &lt;slyon&gt; sarnold: we just have the superficial test in the archive, still. adrien added _actual_ tests in his PPA, but those fail on ppc and s390x
[14:40] &lt;sarnold&gt; ahh
[14:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; now things make sense again
[14:40] &lt;slyon&gt; see two latest comments on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libtracefs/+bug/2051925
[14:40] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2051925 in libtracefs (Ubuntu) "[MIR] promote libtracefs as a trace-cmd dependency" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[14:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think under those conditions, and given the time let us promote it but please commit to continue working with upstream and IBM to fix it
[14:41] &lt;slyon&gt; we're on it already and it will show up in our usual proposed-migration report
[14:41] &lt;slyon&gt; adrien: Can you get the current tests uploaded into noble-proposed?
[14:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah - and with then then promoting it
[14:42] &lt;adrien&gt; slyon: I'm preparing the MR right now
[14:42] &lt;adrien&gt; I'm also backlogging here (I arrived a minute ago)
[14:42] &lt;slyon&gt; cool, thanks. So let's move it to "In Progress" for now?
[14:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is already in mismatches
[14:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so someone else would not understand why not fix comitted
[14:42] &lt;slyon&gt; oh right
[14:42] &lt;adrien&gt; I also updated the LP bug not long ago so some of you might have to refresh the page
[14:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: you might do a summary what we decided here as a comment
[14:43] &lt;slyon&gt; Will do.
[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks
[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Going on to get more cases discussed
[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; from the proposed mismatches
[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; python-boto3 and botocore and s3transfer
[14:43] &lt;adrien&gt; thanks
[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I've done a review on all of them, but the cases were not yet fully ready for a post and since then I'm debugging the beta
[14:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I can post my reviews in a bit, but here the TL;DR
[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; boto3 abd botocore are fine - they mostly lack tests which aciba is working on right now
[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the important thing is that they replace something much worse
[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the old version has been discontinued by upstream ages ago and isn't compatible with the python in noble
[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; So we have two options:
[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; remember: they are ok once the tests land, but need security review then
[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; a) schedule a security review, but let them in now
[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; b) do not promote them in time for noble
[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I do not consider an asap review it the next hours a fair ask for @security
[14:47] &lt;slyon&gt; Is this a release blocker?
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; my argument for (a) would be that all that is proposed while not yet having a review is replacing code that is much older and worse
[14:47] &lt;slyon&gt; I assume the issue is that we do not want to support the old unmaintained thing for 10+ years?
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is a maintenance concern
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; aciba: who joined works on it the last few days
[14:47] &lt;slyon&gt; I have a tendency towards (a) as well, but this is cutting corners with security review..
[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is not breaking the release, hence no strict blocker - but it would be much much better
[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold:  or eslerm_ what do you think about (a) vs (b)
[14:48] &lt;sarnold&gt; there's apparently some new code in here, too "Whilst looking at the package with Alberto, we found that python3-s3transfer, one of the boto3's runtime dependencies, is in Universe, too."
[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yep, the old python-boto did it all by itself
[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; upstream broke that up in individual libs to do these things
[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; moving from boto to boto3 on its own isn't *too* worrying. I'm unhappy that this is only discovered this week but I can kinda understand how we got here. but dragging in a whole new s3 support layer is big ask in the final week.
[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; is this the old boto s3 support split out?
[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; does anything else use this s3 support?
[14:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; AFAICS boto3 and botocore are split out evolutions
[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; s3transfer is only used by boto
[14:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; do we actually care about s3 for simplestreams?
[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; in fact it is only considered to be useful in boto3 as they evolve together
[14:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; can we stub it out?
[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; aciba: ^^ ?
[14:51] &lt;aciba&gt; I think we can, I superficially grep cpc and mass code and they do not use it
[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I assume the problem is that we might beak other users of that library if we'd remove s3 from boto3
[14:51] &lt;aciba&gt; but I am not 100% sure
[14:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; hmm. good point. sigh.
[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; all those three are the newer set of libs
[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and it would allow to demote the old unmaintained one
[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that is kind of what makes me suggest to let them in and demote the old
[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and schedule but not wait for the security review
[14:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; iff you can do both operations in the same minute...
[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the code isn't new - it is just universe -&gt; main
[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah - I can do both at once once ready
[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; waiting for the tests by aciba
[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we'd like to get this out of proposed by ~tomorrow I'd assume to not be in the way of RC images
[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; aciba: can you get tests done by mid day tomorrow?
[14:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; I think I'm coming around to your way of thinking, but I'm not real keen on "just wait until the last week" being used as a way to get beyond the MIR process.
[14:53] &lt;eslerm_&gt; ^
[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: I agree, but have no better option
[14:53] &lt;aciba&gt; I have 3 MRs up, adding build tests and autopkg test, I am verifying autopkgtest work
[14:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; cpaelzer: I mean, the kernel team had their kernels yanked from the upcoming release due to missing deadlines
[14:54] &lt;aciba&gt; I think I could, assuming I have someone reviewing, pushing to -proposed
[14:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and they add it back as we speak
[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm unsure - should we vote
[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this isn't perfect and clean . otherwise we would have settled by now
[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but even time for the meeting runs out :-/
[14:55] &lt;sarnold&gt; heh :(
[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so to get conclusion on this non-easy case ...
[14:55] &lt;sarnold&gt; yeah, I'm fine with a vote
[14:56] &lt;sarnold&gt; but I'd like us to consider how to avoid this situation in future cycles
[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I guess we can be sure that noboday wanted or planned for this
[14:56] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I would really like to see an unmaintained package leave main, otoh there is not time to review and s3 is something that certainly needs security review
[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the problem is that simplestreams being in an ownership nimbus between teams
[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Calling for a vote +1 to let it in under the mentioned constraints (add tests, schedule security review, follow up on findings) -1 to keep the deprecated old python-boto
[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; +1 (for a lack of a better option)
[14:57] &lt;slyon&gt; +1 (same)
[14:57] &lt;sarnold&gt; +1 (but grumpy about it)
[14:57] &lt;eslerm_&gt; +/- 0 (non-vote)
[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; joalif: didrocks: around?
[14:58] &lt;joalif&gt; sorry in other meeting as well, +1
[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks
[14:58]  * cpaelzer is sad that there is nothing better
[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but thanks for everyones understanding
[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and thanks aciba to pick this up in the first place
[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; or we would not even have that option to discuss
[14:58] &lt;aciba&gt; thanks!
[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; aciba: I'll later complete and post my review
[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and let you know if there is something big other than waiting for tests
[14:59] &lt;sarnold&gt; aciba: aye, yes, please don't take this personally. it's better to find and point it out. i'm just dissapointed that we didn't find this in the previous N cycles.
[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'd then bring it up in tomorrow daily release meeting
=== dviererbe1 is now known as dviererbe
[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; to get an ack by release folks before moving it in (or killing it if they object)
[14:59] &lt;aciba&gt; sweet thanks. yeah, totally not taken as personally!
[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so the target to be ready is 4pm CET
[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think we are out of time
[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; just quickly the lists ...

[15:09] &lt;slyon&gt; please everybody take a look after the meeting and give your feedback on GitHub.
[15:09] &lt;eslerm_&gt; libyuv needs a security reviewer still
[15:10] &lt;sarnold&gt; I completely forgot to do the nbd-client review from last week :( sorry.
[15:10] &lt;slyon&gt; eslerm_: on libyuv, Final Freeze should be fine as the latest possible deadline. vpa1977 is preparing the packaging changes in parallel
[15:10] &lt;dviererbe&gt; Is there any action needed from me for the seedchange of dotnet6/8 on mantic jammy?
[15:10] &lt;sarnold&gt; dviererbe: did you submit a merge request for the seed?
[15:10] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I'll see if we can get a reviewer assigned asap

[15:11] &lt;slyon&gt; sarnold: yes we did that
[15:12] &lt;slyon&gt; It just needs an AA to promote it. (But it might be hidden from reports, due to being a retroactive promotion)
[15:12] &lt;slyon&gt; dviererbe: I assume poking AAs about it is your best bet
[15:12] &lt;sarnold&gt; aha, cool; that entire end of the world is pretty hazy :) i'm not sure what else was necessary, I just knew this step remained, hehe
[15:13] &lt;sarnold&gt; yeah, I think pop into #ubuntu-release and mention it and see if anyone's around
[15:14] &lt;dviererbe&gt; Oh.. sorry I see it is merged now. My last update was that it still needs review... waiting on AA then
[15:15] &lt;slyon&gt; dviererbe: waiting might not be enough, though. As the reports only show things about devel/noble. So it might need active pokes to make people look at it
[15:15] &lt;didrocks&gt; (back, waow a lot of backlog!)

[15:20] &lt;sarnold&gt; heh yeah, ping timeouts from irc means something is in pretty bad shape, it's a very forgiving protocol :)

[19:00] &lt;bandali&gt; o/
[19:05] &lt;seb128&gt; sorry, unsure who is around?
[19:05] &lt;seb128&gt; I did a dmb ping on the devel channel, let's wait a few minutes
[19:05] &lt;kanashiro&gt; o/
[19:06] &lt;seb128&gt; nobody declined the calendar invite at least...
[19:06] &lt;teward&gt; i will not be able to stick around here, i've got a NASTY illness right now and am barely awake
[19:06] &lt;teward&gt; so consider me unavailable
[19:09] &lt;seb128&gt; bandali, sorry but it looks we most members aren't there but didn't reflect that on the calendar :-/
[19:09] &lt;seb128&gt; kanashiro, I guess it doesn't make sense to have the meeting with only us right?
[19:10] &lt;bandali&gt; seb128, ack.. would it make sense to wait another 5-10 mins in case folks do show up?
[19:11] &lt;seb128&gt; bandali, we can sure, it's already 10min in though
[19:11]  * bandali nods
[19:12] &lt;kanashiro&gt; agreed
[19:13] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I'm around but buried in release work.
[19:17] &lt;seb128&gt; let's skip then
[19:17] &lt;kanashiro&gt; +!
[19:17] &lt;kanashiro&gt; +1
[19:17] &lt;seb128&gt; bandali, sorry, let's try again after release...

[19:20] &lt;bandali&gt; i'll update my agenda reservation to 2024-04-29 then
[19:42] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; sorry, I am late
[19:43] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; oh there's no meeting, I suppose?

[19:47] &lt;bandali&gt; i did have a reservation on the agenda for today, but most folks didn't show, so i moved it to next meeting :)

[12:08] &lt;stigo&gt; Just wanted to say that I enjoy the format of the Ubuntu Security Podcast, it gives a nice overview of the latest issues
[14:50] &lt;ahasenack&gt; georgiag: hi, morning
[14:50] &lt;ahasenack&gt; I'm getting this apparmor denied log, and am wondering how to best address it
[14:50] &lt;ahasenack&gt; [ter abr 16 17:25:04 2024] audit: type=1400 audit(1712933337.687:2890): apparmor="DENIED" operation="bind" class="net" namespace="root//lxd-n-pro_&lt;var-snap-lxd-common-lxd&gt;" profile="ubuntu_pro_esm_cache_systemctl" pid=348274 comm="systemctl" family="unix" sock_type="stream" protocol=0 requested_mask="bind" denied_mask="bind" addr="@d08132a6b99ec357/bus/systemctl/system"
[14:50] &lt;ahasenack&gt; "network unix," sorts it out
[14:51] &lt;ahasenack&gt; but is there something I can do about the "address" perhaps, to limit it to that */bus/systemctl/system" address?
[14:54] &lt;georgiag&gt; yep, there are specific unix rules that one would look like: unix bind addr=@*/bus/systemctl/system,
[14:54] &lt;ahasenack&gt; so "network unix" plus that?
[14:54] &lt;ahasenack&gt; or just that?
[14:54] &lt;georgiag&gt; just that works
[14:54] &lt;ahasenack&gt; thanks, trying
[14:55] &lt;ahasenack&gt; can I use unix bind addr=@*/bus/systemctl/*, ? I see two addresses:
[14:55] &lt;ahasenack&gt; addr="@5a483abfca663cfc/bus/systemctl/system"
[14:55] &lt;ahasenack&gt; and also
[14:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; addr="@e85173dd91675953/bus/systemctl/"
[14:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; or just list both?
[14:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; two "unix bind" lines
[14:56] &lt;georgiag&gt; addr=@*/bus/systemctl/{,system} seems more strict 
[14:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; does this use the normal path globbing rules?
[14:56] &lt;georgiag&gt; it does
[14:57] &lt;ahasenack&gt; awesome

[15:00] &lt;sbeattie&gt; tomreyn: I poked a little, but the xz tire fire and resulting mass rebuild of noble packages to compensate interfered. I'll nudge again.
[15:01] &lt;tomreyn&gt; sbeattie: thanks. if i should try to contact folks on my own, i can try that, too, but would need to know whom to contact. (i did so previously, actually, but got no response)

[14:33] &lt;adrien&gt; sergiodj: AFAIU you did most of the work for debuginfod support (thanks btw!) and I'm wondering if it's available to autopkgtest which would imply the data for the package built/tested would be available through debuginfod which sounds like it would require additional work
[14:34] &lt;adrien&gt; an alternative is to add a depend on the dbgsym package for the tests which is easy to do per-package but I'm wondering which way to prefer
[14:34] &lt;adrien&gt; thanks :)
[14:38] &lt;adrien&gt; oops, wrong channel, sorry, should have been -devel probably
[14:53] &lt;schopin&gt; adrien: fwiw, I think symbols are available as soon as a package is published in -proposed.
[14:54] &lt;adrien&gt; schopin: good to know; unfortunately I'm testing a PPA
[14:55] &lt;adrien&gt; discourse is still down as far as I can tell so I guess we can put a short status here (let me know if someone sees discourse as up)
[14:56] &lt;adrien&gt; (it's failing at some step, it's not completely down, so probably not network-related)
[14:57] &lt;dviererbe&gt; o/
[14:58] &lt;zhsj&gt; o/
[14:58] &lt;sergiodj&gt; adrien: PPAs are not indexed by our debuginfod instance, unfortunately. otherwise, it's what schopin said: when packages are published in -proposed debuginfod will index them within 2 hours
[14:59] &lt;sergiodj&gt; (actually, _some_ special PPAs are indexed, but they're related to ESM)
[14:59] &lt;adrien&gt; short status: mostly libtracefs MIR for which tests are now running, but that means I get to learn about the many many failures on s390x and ppc64el; also looking at updating gnutls and openssl to their latest versions (no new openssl version is published but maybe a git tag will make sense)

[15:00] &lt;adrien&gt; sergiodj: thanks, and I think that makes sense, you probably don't want to have everything from all PPAs there; I think I'll add a dependency on dbgsym, at least because it will help me get useful traces for s390x and ppc64el test failures

[15:07] &lt;bdmurray&gt; take for the final release?
[15:07] &lt;juliank&gt; Should we set milestone 24.04?
[15:08] &lt;juliank&gt; slyon: ^
[15:08] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Yes, a milestone would help the release team have visibility into it.
[15:08] &lt;slyon&gt; not sure.. I cannot yet estimate the side effects
[15:09] &lt;enr0n&gt; IMO yes. Otherwise we are asking for a fun flood of bug reports about this
[15:09] &lt;juliank&gt; Not sure + yes is a yes
[15:09] &lt;slyon&gt; alright
[15:10] &lt;juliank&gt; tagged
[15:10] &lt;juliank&gt; targeted to 24.04
[15:11] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2060581 is already staged so untagged it

[15:13] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2060220 seems straightforward
[15:13] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2060220 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "Prevent release upgrades for users running on armhf" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2060220
[15:13] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: I saw a package that needed to migrate but it had picked up a versioned dep on your libdebian-installer NCR ;P
[15:14] &lt;schopin&gt; I don't know. I think the problem raised here that you'll get a mix of 23.10 and 24.04 packages is already the case on any other arch?
[15:14] &lt;juliank&gt; sigh
[15:14] &lt;juliank&gt; This isn't _really_ a problem
[15:14] &lt;juliank&gt; u-r-u offers to remove obsolete packages (mantic-noble/jammy-noble)
[15:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; as I said in the bug comment I think this should be a raspi-specific quirk
[15:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; since that's the supported platform whose kernel gets dropped
[15:15] &lt;waveform&gt; indeed
[15:15] &lt;juliank&gt; I think it should be a quirk for some "key packages"
[15:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; and we shouldn't let users think they've upgraded to a supported LTS when the #1 CVE target is unsupported
[15:16] &lt;juliank&gt; I mean block upgrades if any package they use from main got dropped
[15:17] &lt;bdmurray&gt; How can we check if they are on an RPi?
[15:18] &lt;juliank&gt; check the kernel
[15:18] &lt;waveform&gt; hmm, checking for linux-raspi is usually a good sign, but theoretically isn't enough
[15:18] &lt;juliank&gt; linux-raspi-*
[15:18] &lt;juliank&gt; linux-image-raspi-*
[15:18] &lt;waveform&gt; (if it's installed it may not be flashed as the actual booting kernel; so uname -r with a -raspi suffix is probably a good sign for the running kernel)
[15:19] &lt;waveform&gt; alternately, check for raspberrypi in /proc/device-tree/compatible if it exists
[15:19] &lt;waveform&gt; (substring)
[15:20] &lt;juliank&gt; I think package is more interesting tbh
[15:20] &lt;waveform&gt; package can be installed (but not flashed) on generic arm64 hardware
[15:21] &lt;waveform&gt; (yes, that's stupid, but possible :)
[15:21] &lt;juliank&gt; I know but still the image as a whole would be unsupported
[15:21] &lt;juliank&gt; maybe you are building the image on your other arm64 hardware and then want to put it into a pi
[15:21] &lt;juliank&gt; :D
[15:21] &lt;waveform&gt; but the test is for "are we running on a pi?"
[15:22] &lt;juliank&gt; Yes, but I prefer to be safe than sorry :D
[15:23] &lt;juliank&gt; And that gives us an easier way to mark other packages
[15:23] &lt;juliank&gt; Anyway
[15:23] &lt;juliank&gt; let's move on
[15:23] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 1951491

[15:24] &lt;juliank&gt; Ah yes I marked that incomplete
[15:24] &lt;juliank&gt; I forgot to drop the tag

[15:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; does it load?
[15:28] &lt;juliank&gt; (I forgot to say: ff was empty)
[15:28] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon: it's quiten ice
[15:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; not bad
[15:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; 17 packages needing attention, 214 packages not yet considered late
[15:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; oy who uploaded 214 packages
[15:28] &lt;juliank&gt; o/
[15:28] &lt;schopin&gt; I wanna blame Julian
[15:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; :|
[15:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; right, so a short enough list we can actually assign
[15:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; usb.ids: liushuyu please?
[15:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; bzip2: schopin?
[15:30] &lt;schopin&gt; vorlon: ack
[15:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; gcc-14-cross: doko: you commented about demotions but it looks like you haven't done whatever re-promotions are required here, I'll leave this with you
[15:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; nullboot: just unblocked this by removing the arm64 binary from the release pocket, will migrate
[15:31] &lt;liushuyu&gt; vorlon: understood
[15:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; sphinx vs xorg-server: ravikant_?
[15:31] &lt;ravikant_&gt; vorlon: ack
[15:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-packaging: pushkarnk
[15:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; gcc-11: upils_
[15:32] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; vorlon: ack
[15:32] &lt;upils_&gt; ack
[15:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; upils_: you'll probably end up coordinating w/ doko but he's not here right now, so anyway :)
[15:32] &lt;upils_&gt; noted
[15:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; golang-1.22: zhsj
[15:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; avahi: ogayot
[15:33] &lt;ogayot&gt; vorlon: ack
[15:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; tzdata: bdrung
[15:33] &lt;zhsj&gt; ack
[15:34] &lt;schopin&gt; just to be clear, the freeze block hint is going to be lifted once beta is out, right?
[15:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; nfs-utils vs libnfs hmm ahasenack has been looking at this for the server team. enr0n can you work with him on this to sort out if this is a baseline regression and we should ignore the s390x failure?
[15:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; openjdk-21 vs cups: mateus-morais
[15:35] &lt;enr0n&gt; vorlon: ack
[15:35] &lt;mateus-morais&gt; vorlon: ack
[15:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; pci.ids: looks to be the same fusioninventory-agent failure as for usb.ids so giving this to liushuyu also
[15:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; heh openjdk-21 blocked because it makes openjdk-23's tests fail on arm64?
[15:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; mkukri: openjdk-21 vs openjdk-23 please
[15:36] &lt;liushuyu&gt; vorlon: okay
[15:36] &lt;mkukri&gt; mkukri: ack
[15:36]  * mkukri fears java
[15:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; mtd-utils: slyon
[15:36] &lt;slyon&gt; ack
[15:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; mkukri: it may just require test retries :)
[15:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; anyway that's all the list for today
[15:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank:
[15:38] &lt;vorlon&gt; (we'll want to get as much of the rest through before release as possible, but those no-change rebuilds are by and large not critical and I won't assign them out)
[15:38] &lt;Skia&gt; just to be sure everyone know: we've had a lot of "no space left on device" issues recently on autopkgtest. If a log appears cropped, it's probably due to that, and you better retry it right away.
[15:38] &lt;vorlon&gt; schopin: yes we lift the proposed-migration freeze after beta (but leave the archive freeze in place)
[15:39] &lt;schopin&gt; thanks
[15:41] &lt;juliank&gt; oh
[15:41] &lt;juliank&gt; #topic AOB
[15:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; nothing here!
[15:44] &lt;ahasenack&gt; vorlon: just saw the highlight on nfs-utils
[15:44] &lt;ahasenack&gt; it's a kernel bug, ibm found the commit that broke it, and sent a patch to the kernel list (upstream)
[15:45] &lt;ahasenack&gt; https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nfs-utils/+bug/2060217
[15:45] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2060217 in nfs-utils (Ubuntu) "NFSv4 fails to mount in noble/s390x" [High, Triaged]
[15:45] &lt;vorlon&gt; ahasenack: so would a baseline retest clear this as a regression?
[15:45] &lt;ahasenack&gt; migration-reference? If it runs on the same host kernel, yes
[15:46] &lt;vorlon&gt; yes
[15:48] &lt;juliank&gt; OK I think that's it

[14:37] &lt;brlin&gt; Hello, I would like to ask whether the CVE-2023-6546 vulnerability has been dealt with in the Ubuntu kernels?  I unable to locate notices about it in the USN.

This issue occurs when two threads execute the GSMIOC_SETCONF ioctl on the same tty file descriptor with the gsm line discipline enabled, and can lead to a use-after-free problem on a struct gsm_dlci while restarting the gsm mux. This could allow a local unprivileged user to escalate the... &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-6546&gt;
[14:38]  * brlin Good bot (pats).
[14:39] &lt;brlin&gt; Additional info: https://github.com/YuriiCrimson/ExploitGSM (There seems to be a conflict of who is the original author of the PoC, though it's not really our businesses.)

[14:48] &lt;tomreyn&gt; and i'm not speaking for ubuntu or the security team
[14:54] &lt;brlin&gt; tomreyn: Thanks for the information!  I'll check it out.

[15:10] &lt;brlin&gt; sbeattie: Thanks for the information mOwOm.
[15:13] &lt;sbeattie&gt; brlin: oh, boo, the initial fix for CVE-2023-6546 got reverted upstream: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=29346e217b8ab8a52889b88f00b268278d6b7668

[15:14] &lt;brlin&gt; sbeattie: That's...interesting.
[15:16] &lt;brlin&gt; Though the upstream should have a following patch to fix the vulnerability, right?
[15:19] &lt;sbeattie&gt; brlin: sorry, I'm confusing myself by doing this without enough coffee.
[15:20] &lt;sbeattie&gt; brlin: the fix for CVE-2023-6546, 3c4f8333b582 ("tty: n_gsm: fix the UAF caused by race condition in gsm_cleanup_mux"), was not reverted.

[15:21] &lt;brlin&gt; sbeattie: No worries.  Thanks for the confirmation, BTW.
[15:22] &lt;sbeattie&gt; but that commit references fixing 9b9c8195f3f0 ("tty: n_gsm: fix UAF in gsm_cleanup_mux") which is also what got reverted in 29346e217b8ab8a52889b88f00b268278d6b7668 linked above
[15:23]  * brlin Probably will try the PoC on a fresh cloud VM just to see if it works.
[15:23] &lt;sbeattie&gt; so while I think CVE-2023-6546 in isolation may be "fixed" there are still other UAFs in the n_gsm.c code, the root cause explained by the revert commit

[15:24] &lt;brlin&gt; Thanks for the analysis.
[15:24] &lt;sbeattie&gt; bah, the bot needs a silence cache, to not report the same CVE id in the space of a few minutes.
[15:24]  * brlin lmao
[15:26] &lt;sbeattie&gt; The english writeup at https://jmpeax.dev/The-tale-of-a-GSM-Kernel-LPE.html has a screenshot at the end of running the exploit on ubuntu against a 6.5.0-25 ubuntu kernel; if not doctored (I don't think it is, but you never know), that kernel has the commit  3c4f8333b582 ("tty: n_gsm: fix the UAF caused by race condition in gsm_cleanup_mux"
[15:33] &lt;sbeattie&gt; looking through the commit history for n_gsm.c, I'm not seeing anything that would fix that, but that's based on a quick perusal.
[15:36] &lt;sbeattie&gt; Thanks for raising the issue.
[15:55] &lt;brlin&gt; sbeattie: No problem.
[18:27] &lt;brlin&gt; sbeattie: I'd like to inform you that I am able to reproduce the vulnerability on a GCP Compute Engine instance running `6.5.0-27-generic` Ubuntu kernel(the GCP kernel doesn't seemed to be vulnerable as the n_gsm module doesn't seem to be built).  The first invocation of the PoC code stuck at the `waiting setconf dlci thread` stage, but the second invocation get me a root shell.  This is reproduced using the 2e87080 revision of the PoC.
[18:29]  * brlin Thinks as the PoC is already in the wild, there's probably no reason to discuss it in private, but do inform me if I'm wrong.
[18:33] &lt;sbeattie&gt; brlin: thanks for reproducing, I agree, the writeups are public, so no sense trying to keep it private
[18:34] &lt;brlin&gt; Note that the OffsetGenerater program in the PoC code must first be run (as root, but possibly can be done in another host with the same kernel) to generate the data that needs to be inserted in the `kernels_offsets` array of the PoC code(~line 370).  I'll leave the matter to you :D.

[14:32] &lt;slyon&gt; I'd like to ask cpaelzer to check this ^ as I think you have the most context.
[14:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ack on bpf, I resolved that
[14:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; trace-cmd ack on looking good but needing a bit
[14:32] &lt;slyon&gt; It should be a quick "versioned package" upgrade, I assume. Correct, dviererbe?
[14:33] &lt;dviererbe&gt; Yes
[14:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; on dotnet8 I didn't feel there was much open other than asking "do we need a full process again"
[14:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; reading ...

[14:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so many recent updates
[14:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; should we go top to bottom?
[14:36] &lt;slyon&gt; ok. bug #2004516

[14:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, that says escalate to have a chance
[14:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; which I think is reasonable
[14:37] &lt;slyon&gt; This is blocked on security-review. but it's too late. I think it's not high priority and not necessarily needed for 24.04. So probably no need for escalation. I'll double check with ravikant_
[14:37] &lt;slyon&gt; bug #2051925
[14:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes

[14:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and update the case either way
[14:37] &lt;slyon&gt; will do
[14:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; part of the bigger "perf tools for ubuntu by default" movement
[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; "I'm working on this and mostly finishing the changes." sounds good
[14:38] &lt;slyon&gt; right. that should be the last missing piece for trace-cmd

[14:38] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: you were the original reviewer. This is part of the libgd2 -&gt; libheif -&gt; ... chain, which is moving closer to completion
[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; same as libyuv - although I'd love to have that in next LTS
[14:39] &lt;slyon&gt; Vladimir told me he did the work on this in Debian an it's sync'ed, can you double-check the requirements, cpaelzer ?
[14:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; oh no, security has passed that already
[14:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah I can check against my requests from the review
[14:39] &lt;slyon&gt; thanks
[14:39] &lt;sarnold&gt; can this move forward if libyuv doesn't?
[14:39] &lt;slyon&gt; no it can't
[14:40] &lt;slyon&gt; well... it could probably, but doesn't make a lot of sense I think
[14:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; well,  libde265 could - but there is no point for the final use case without the other
[14:40] &lt;adrien&gt; for libtracefs, I think I'm only left waiting on test results (I think I triggered the tests too early and it didn't pick the version in the PPA sadly)

[14:43] &lt;slyon&gt; this is a case of "to re-review security" or "not to re-review security"
[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; +1 vote on should-be-reviewed
[14:43] &lt;slyon&gt; It would be useful, but we're past the point where we can make it happen for 24.04 I assume? I'll double-check with waveform to see how critical this is
[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; or is this "needs to be in noble in main asap" panic (still review but later then)?
[14:44] &lt;slyon&gt; I'll try to find out
[14:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and if you need it
[14:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; go the "escalate with security" path
[14:44] &lt;waveform&gt; slyon, it's one of the items on my roadmap but it's not going to "break the image" if it has to go red
[14:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; See the update by Seth on the other bug
[14:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; if you (and mclemenceau_) think we should have it
[14:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; escalate it now
[14:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and we might
[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; waveform: can this be "added to main later" ?
[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we have done component moves after the release, that isn't impossible
[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so could it be ready for 24.04.1 ?
[14:45] &lt;waveform&gt; well, the idea of including it in the image was to enable netboot of the release image, so if we add it to main later it'll only really benefit .1 onwards
[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; or is - after that is approved - a "major revamp how everything works" needed?
[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm mostly, is this a "safe addition" later or is this "to be used break the world" change
[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; if it is the former, we can make it happen toward 24.04.1 and that should be our goal then IMHO
[14:46] &lt;waveform&gt; oh, safe addition -- it's basically just enabling the initramfs to support nbd boot (assuming the necessary kernel param is present)
[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, how about that - not giving up on the item but timing it towards that?
[14:46] &lt;eslerm_&gt; o/
[14:46] &lt;sarnold&gt; given that this package had been in main itself, it's 'just'a binary package move, and I don't recall seeing it as a source of work, and that the attack surface is largely in the kernel, I think I'd encourage this to go to main in time for 24.04 release
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; update the bug in that case and security can review without panic-priority
[14:47] &lt;waveform&gt; I'm fine with that (enabling for .1)
[14:47] &lt;adrien&gt; I do have a question for libtracefs btw: I've addressed comments; does the MIR team still needs to be involved or could a regular review before upload do it? (sorry to come back late to this)
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: sure, if you consider this a quick security review - let us make the change for 24.04
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm sure waveform will be happy
[14:47] &lt;waveform&gt; I would love it to go into 24.04 but if it has to be shunted, I'm okay with that too
[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; how about this - sarnold spends 20 minutes, and gives a shallow security review based on this being in main in the past kind of alreay
[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; if that outcome is good, get it into 24.04
[14:48] &lt;sarnold&gt; wfm
[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; if not, see former plan for 24.04.1
[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; great
[14:48] &lt;waveform&gt; sure
[14:48] &lt;slyon&gt; very nice! thanks
[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; waveform: sarnold: work together and make my Pi NBD boot!
[14:48] &lt;sarnold&gt; :D

[14:53] &lt;dviererbe&gt; A follow up question to the dotnet6 MIR: Do I need to find an Archive Admin to do the promotion or will someone take care of this eventually before 24.04 GA?
[14:53] &lt;slyon&gt; adrien: can you please repeat your question from above?
[14:53] &lt;slyon&gt; dviererbe: AAs usually pick it up from the report, once the MIR status is "Fix Committed"
[14:54] &lt;slyon&gt; and it is seeded/pulled as a dependency
[14:54] &lt;sarnold&gt; dviererbe: the last comment from cpaelzer is "ready for you to change seeds" -- do know if this step has been done yet?
[14:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I do not see it in component mismatches
[14:54] &lt;slyon&gt; neither do I
[14:54] &lt;dviererbe&gt; No, I don't think so
[14:55] &lt;mirespace&gt; o/ for the DMARC perl, do you need anything from me to decide about libmime-tools vs libemail-mime ?
[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Hi mirespace -  who are you asking in particular?
[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; security, MIR in general, ... ?
[14:55] &lt;slyon&gt; mirespace: did you see this update? https://github.com/rjbs/Email-MIME/issues/66#issuecomment-2024085120 (cc eslerm_)
[14:55] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Issue 66 in rjbs/Email-MIME "DoS on excessive or deeply nested parts" [Open]
[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; there is so much context that sadly left my memory
[14:55] &lt;adrien&gt; slyon: my question is whether the MIR team expects to have further MIR-specific comments for libtracefs or if any uploader/reviewer could check the open items effectively
[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; dviererbe: for your case, do you know what is expected from you to change seeds for this?
[14:56] &lt;mirespace&gt; _checking that link_
[14:56] &lt;dviererbe&gt; cpaelzer: not really, I have never done this so far
[14:56] &lt;adrien&gt; I've been addressing all the open comments and I'm almost done (it looks like something still isn't ready but it shouldn't take much longer)
[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; dviererbe: and you can be bold, and do it for dotnet6 and dotnet8 (for noble) to make them supported (but do not pre-install them anywhere)
[14:56] &lt;slyon&gt; adrien: you get the upload done and then a MIR team member needs to approve the bug report by changing to the relevant status
[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: can you teach dviererbe or organize that someone else does?
[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; foundations internal I mean
[14:57] &lt;slyon&gt; sure dviererbe. I can help with that. please reach out to me on MM
[14:57] &lt;adrien&gt; slyon: hmmm, right, the question is mostly moot indeed
[14:57] &lt;dviererbe&gt; slyon: ack
[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; adrien: once you think it is ready, update the case. And for urgency get in touch with me or slyon (to not wait for next Tue)
[14:57] &lt;mirespace&gt; :O ... so the MIME DoS issue is not toatally resolved...
[14:57] &lt;adrien&gt; cpaelzer: thanks
[14:58] &lt;mirespace&gt; cpaelzer: I was worried that the debate between mime-tools and email-mime could make the MIR being stuck
[14:59] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I would like to see rjbs/Email-MIME in 24.04, the upstream devs do great work at fastmail
[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm worried as well, but too far from it to have a good understanding atm
[14:59] &lt;slyon&gt; mirespace: can you remind us of the LP bug number?
[14:59] &lt;slyon&gt; it didn't show up in today's lists
[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; also collision and I need to leave for the next meeting

[15:00] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: see https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/msgraph/+bug/2060035 (you can reply on that bug later)
[15:00] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2060035 in msgraph (Ubuntu) "[MIR] msgraph" [Undecided, Confirmed]
[15:00] &lt;slyon&gt; Not sure what to do about the libgoa-* dependency or why we check for it during the MIR review. It's been there for historical reasons. But we need it in this case
[15:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm_: to what extend it rjibs/Email-MIME and similar good wishes for the future but no blockers for now
[15:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; after all time for 24.04 runs out and I understand mirespace getting concerned
[15:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; mirespace:  what are the options we have there
[15:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; is it:
[15:01] &lt;eslerm_&gt; libmail-dmarc-perl does have an ack, the open issue needs to be solved, but *might* not be a blocker (Seth?)
[15:02] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I fail to summarize it :-/
[15:02] &lt;mclemenceau_&gt; thanks cpaelzer sarnold, I'm ok with the plan w.r.t netboot with a preference for addition in 24.04 :)
[15:02] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I don't mind contacting upstream and asking if they can make a plan
[15:02] &lt;mirespace&gt; use the change we did to use libmime-tools-perl, diverging from upstream
[15:02] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, consider ^^ option (a)
[15:03] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; what is option (b)
[15:03] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: for libgoa - it can be a build dependency, just not a runtime dependency (and not part of the final code, no static linking tricks)
[15:03] &lt;mirespace&gt; if (a) is libemail-mime contacting upstream, option (b)is  use libmime-tools, diverging upstream
[15:04] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: ACK. thanks I'll update the case
[15:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: but if it is used at build to get stuff done (like test tools, binary mangling helpers, ...) then it does not need to be in main
[15:04] &lt;sarnold&gt; (or 'it's not a library it's just a .h file tricks :)
[15:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: &gt;Trusty, before it had to be
[15:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: yes, that I count as "static code active in the final binary" which would need to be in main
[15:05] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: just as much as any other similar trick
[15:05] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; back to mime
[15:05] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm_: mirespace: what is the way forward
[15:05] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm_: you said the open issue might (tm) not be a blocker
[15:05] &lt;slyon&gt; libgoa being gnome-online-accounts, right? I.e. https://packages.ubuntu.com/noble/libgoa-1.0-0b
[15:05] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; just an important "we want to work thazt out in the long run"
[15:06] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; if it is really that, can we go on with the promotion of that stack then?
[15:06] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; as-is I mean
[15:06] &lt;mirespace&gt; the promotion form my PPA uses libmime-tools by the moment
[15:06] &lt;eslerm_&gt; since these are ack'd I am okay with pushing through if Seth agrees. If so, I can contact upstream and try to settle issues.
[15:06] &lt;mirespace&gt; because emailÃ±-mime introduced duplicity
[15:07] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sounds like a good plan compromise, unblock now, do not give up on making it better
[15:07] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and thanks for the offer to contact upstream
[15:07] &lt;sarnold&gt; I'm a bit worried that comment #27 on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libmail-dmarc-perl/+bug/2023971 suggests that there's even MORE packages to MIR in order to "just ship what debian ships"
[15:07] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2023971 in libmail-dmarc-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libmail-dmarc-perl" [High, Incomplete]
[15:07] &lt;eslerm_&gt; (I'll message upstream today)
[15:07] &lt;sarnold&gt; but I have to admit that this is a twisty maze of package names that all collide into one single mental hashbucket and I've long ago lost the plot
[15:07] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: well, we can slowly sort that out one by one &gt;24.04
[15:08] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the question is can we take the current approved set for 24.04 and resolve it here?
[15:09] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; if yes, then I'd ask mirespace to work with bryce to prepare the seed/dependency changes and prepare a session telling me what would need to be promoted and why. I could check one by one - if all good mass promotion
[15:09] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; mirespace: will work on several follow up items anyway, like the elliptic curve lib wrapper and such
[15:10] &lt;mirespace&gt; for me it's ok
[15:11] &lt;slyon&gt; +1
[15:12] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so to summarize, eslerm_ contacts upstreams for a better path forward. mirespace will prep and lay out what we have ready and can land for 24.04
[15:12] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; short: get what we have to noble, mid term make it better
[15:12] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I can do that :)
[15:13] &lt;mirespace&gt; sounds like a plan :)
[15:13] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; mirespace: can you work with bryce to get all in line (probably some blocks by the beta freeze) and then get in touch
[15:13] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is work, but better than the unclear state before
[15:13] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, we are way over time
[15:13] &lt;mirespace&gt; yes, I do.. thank you all for unblocking this
[15:13] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: time to get to the end :-) ?
[15:13] &lt;sarnold&gt; i'm probably not going to come to a good udnerstanding of the whole problem space and the options quickly .. so here's a few of my general thoughts: (a) I'd prefer to not diverge from debian and the upstreams if we can (b) i'm fine with shipping mirespace's "lets change packages to meet our existing main requirements" but I'm not wedded to it (c) I'm not too worried about a 1 meg --&gt; 2 gigs of ram
[15:13] &lt;sarnold&gt; DOS, that'd probably be tolerable enough to fix post-release if upstream doesn't get to it sooner
[15:14] &lt;sarnold&gt; (doesn't every mail server have 100 gigs ram? :)
[15:14] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; almost
[15:14] &lt;slyon&gt; thanks for the summary!

[19:09] &lt;seb128&gt; there is https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-March/002913.html but that doesn't really seem to be a TB topic
[19:09] &lt;teward&gt; *raises hand briefly*
[19:09] &lt;seb128&gt; teward, yes?
[19:10] &lt;teward&gt; regarding that, there was one sent to the CC and other teams as well as Canonical's teams.
[19:10] &lt;teward&gt; CC hasn't addressed it yet, but Canonical (Fallen, etc.) were starting to investigate best approaches
[19:10] &lt;teward&gt; just wanted to have that on the record.
[19:10] &lt;teward&gt; (expected it to show up here)
[19:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; It sounds like something the nearest Loco could take up perhaps?
[19:10] &lt;teward&gt; ^^ that
[19:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; Happy to hear that it's being looked at. Thank you!

[19:11] &lt;seb128&gt; https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-March/002905.html (Call for vote: Ubuntu Cinnamon 24.04 LTS Qualification)
[19:12] &lt;seb128&gt; afaik only amurray and me voted
[19:12] &lt;seb128&gt; can we get some other members to also vote?
[19:12] &lt;vorlon&gt; I have a concern about the "contact" being a list of ~10 people
[19:12] &lt;vorlon&gt; I've raised similar concerns with other flavor applications before
[19:13] &lt;vorlon&gt; but I haven't had time to respond to the list about this
[19:13] &lt;seb128&gt; can you follow up on the list with that concern?
[19:13] &lt;vorlon&gt; yes
[19:13] &lt;seb128&gt; thanks
[19:13] &lt;seb128&gt; want an action item for it?
[19:13] &lt;vorlon&gt; but mentioning here this is what's blocked me from +1'ing
[19:13] &lt;vorlon&gt; I'll accept an action item :)
[19:14] &lt;seb128&gt; #action vorlon to follow up on the Cinnamon 24.04 LTS Qualification re the number of contacts listed for the flavor
[19:14] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: vorlon to follow up on the Cinnamon 24.04 LTS Qualification re the number of contacts listed for the flavor
[19:14] &lt;seb128&gt; no other topic on the list that I can see (outside of the DMB election which we discussed earlier)

=== chris14_ is now known as chris14
[01:36] &lt;blahdeblah&gt; amurray: +1 to that - I think there'll be ongoing fun from this one.
[01:36] &lt;blahdeblah&gt; Although I would probably nitpick your characterisation of it as the biggest Open Source issue since Meltdown/Spectre.  What about log4shell?  Much more widely exploited...
[02:08] &lt;amurray&gt; blahdeblah: oh indeed, log4shell was more exploited, but I don't think I have seen an issue get so much n news coverage so quickly as this 
[02:08] &lt;blahdeblah&gt; In terms of hype it's definitely up there. :-)

[00:06] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; still somebody here? Another question. I'm checking an apparmor profile at package build time, using apparmor_parser, trying to detect (and avoid) syntax errors
[00:06] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; so I call it like "apparmor_parser -K -T -Q &lt;file&gt;"
[00:06] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; works fine
[00:06] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; except I now have "#include &lt;local/foo&gt;"
[00:06] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; and /etc/apparmor.d/local/foo doesn't exist in the build environment
[00:06] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; so that started failing
[00:07] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; I found the -I option, and it seems to work
[00:07] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; so, just double checking with another pair of eyes:
[00:07] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; $ l debian/apparmor/local/ubuntu_pro_apt_news debian/apparmor/ubuntu_pro_apt_news
[00:07] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; -rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu    0 Apr  4 23:49 debian/apparmor/local/ubuntu_pro_apt_news
[00:07] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; -rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu 1.2K Apr  4 23:48 debian/apparmor/ubuntu_pro_apt_news
[00:07] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; and
[00:07] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; $ apparmor_parser -I $(pwd)/debian/apparmor -K -T -Q debian/apparmor/ubuntu_pro_apt_news ; echo $?
[00:07] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; 0
[00:08] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; looks good?
[00:09] &lt;sarnold&gt; probably fine; though I see the other examples in my /etc/apparmor.d/local/ are 644 and not 664
[00:10] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; ah, ok, ddn't check that. Just did a "touch"
[00:10] &lt;sarnold&gt; we've got an 'include if exists' but I don't see anything using that yet :/ so I don't know if this should be the first or if it's better to just follow along the pattern that the others do
[00:10] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; looks like my umask is lax
[00:10] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; I thought of that, but I don't think it exists in xenial
[00:11] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; let me see if I have a xenial vm...
[00:11] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; just to make sure
[00:12] &lt;sarnold&gt; *xenial* ugh I forgot
[00:12] &lt;sarnold&gt; yeah just stick with what you've got
[00:12] &lt;sarnold&gt; I can't recall when this was introduced but xenial seems likely to be pushing it :)
[00:14] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; it's not in the xenial apparmor.d manapge, but is in the jammy one
[00:14] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; x:            INCLUDE = '#include' ( ABS PATH | MAGIC PATH )
[00:15] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; j:            INCLUDE = ( '#include' | 'include' ) [ 'if exists' ] ( ABS PATH | MAGIC PATH )
[00:15] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; was added somewhere in between
[00:15] &lt;sarnold&gt; i'm glad you went looking rather than just using it :)
[00:21] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; not my first xenial apparmor profile in the recent months ;)
[00:21] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; was bitten before
[00:24] &lt;sarnold&gt; hehehe :(

[20:38] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; georgiag: hi, quick q
[20:38] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; georgiag: when I have a profile file that defines child profiles,
[20:39] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; profile {
[20:39] &lt;ahasenack_&gt;   ...rules...
[20:39] &lt;ahasenack_&gt;   profile {
[20:39] &lt;ahasenack_&gt;   }
[20:39] &lt;ahasenack_&gt;   ..more rules..
[20:39] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; }
[20:39] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; is that "more rules" bit allowed there, after the child pofile is defined?
[20:39] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; I still want it in the context of the parent profile
[20:40] &lt;sdeziel&gt; ahasenack_: yes
[20:40] &lt;georgiag&gt; yep, it shouldn't matter
[20:40] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; ok
[20:40] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; I need to add the missing #include &lt;local/...&gt; line
[20:40] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; that usually goes at the end
[20:40] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; but here, "the end" is after other child profiles were defined

[15:09] &lt;vorlon&gt; - preparing the design of t-shirts which read "I talked to Jia Tan"

[15:10] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Is the Milk-V Mars some new hardware we'll be supporting. xypron ?
[15:10] &lt;adrien&gt; I suck at design so only white letters on black t-shirt ;-)
[15:10] &lt;xypron&gt; bdmurray: nothing decided yet
[15:11] &lt;xypron&gt; It is a RISC-V board with the same SoC as the VisionFive2 which we support.
[15:12] &lt;vorlon&gt; adrien: that's fine, it goes right along with the "No I won't fix your laptop but mjg59 will" tshirt in my drawer
[15:12] &lt;juliank&gt; Does anyone want some more time for status update reading/discussion? We have 2 incoming bugs to discuss today
[15:13] &lt;adrien&gt; vorlon: :D   but now maybe I really need to make that t-shirt...

[15:15] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 1951491 in snapd (Ubuntu) "Can't run snaps: .slice/session-1.scope is not a snap cgroup" [High, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1951491
[15:16] &lt;juliank&gt; I think this is expected sort of?
[15:16] &lt;juliank&gt; People seem to try to run stuff as a different user in a cron job without having a user session for that user
[15:17] &lt;juliank&gt; Like this is not how you do this:
[15:17] &lt;juliank&gt; I had to install dbus-user-session and then make sure the /run/user/../bus was initialized by for example runuser -u user /bin/true.
[15:17] &lt;juliank&gt; And make sure that it remains by loginctl enable-linger user
[15:17] &lt;juliank&gt; But how is VNC related to it?
[15:18] &lt;mkukri&gt; that makes sense, but i am not sure if a user can reasonable figure that
[15:18] &lt;juliank&gt; I think there's probably 3 issues mixed into one at that point
[15:18] &lt;juliank&gt; Yeah some others somehow ended up with sessions without a session bus
[15:19] &lt;juliank&gt; Closing the entire thing and asking for clear bugs would be a good start?
[15:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; no objection
[15:22] &lt;vorlon&gt; next? :)
[15:22] &lt;juliank&gt; Since there was no opposition I've just done that, marking them all Incomplete and asking people to file clear succinct bugs
[15:22] &lt;juliank&gt; Writing took a while :)

[15:24] &lt;juliank&gt; yes but does it make sense assigning vs someone solving it in adhoc fashion
[15:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; I guess what I'll say here is, if anybody doesn't have a corner of the xz-utils migration to work on right now, this is a useful additional list to draw from
[15:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; but yes I don't think assigning individual packages here makes sense when we're in an all-hands-on-deck situation for xz-utils
[15:25] &lt;juliank&gt; Do we want to talk about xz-utils?
[15:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; does someone need us to?

[15:26] &lt;juliank&gt; So be it
[15:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; well, I can tell y'all what my plan is for my work day wrt xz-utils
[15:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; which is that by EOD I intend to have Ubuntu Desktop images buildable
[15:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; by hook or by crook
[15:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; so skiptesting anything necessary to get packages migrated
[15:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; stage 1 is still getting livecd-rootfs installable
[15:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; stage 2 is making debootstrap work
[15:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; stage 3 is making ubuntu-desktop installable
[15:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; help wanted to make sure we minimize regressing things in the process

[19:53] &lt;jnsgruk&gt; Good evening all! :)
[19:54] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; jnsgruk: Hello - we get started in a few moments.
[19:59] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; jnsgruk: Daylight savings time effect ? We are awaiting board members to check in.
[20:08] &lt;jnsgruk&gt; Looks like the logs from earlier on people were around, so perhaps just bad luck on availability?
[20:10] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; jnsgruk: Beginning to wonder what is not taking place :)
[20:14] &lt;jnsgruk&gt; Any chance people are holding out for the 2200 UTC meeting?
[20:17] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; jnsgruk: Such would be unusual - I checked my E-mail and no advisories there. I have no real ideas of what the circumstances can be that the members fail to appear. // wait some more.
[20:18] &lt;jnsgruk&gt; Will do :)
[20:43] &lt;jnsgruk&gt; Bashing-om will you be around for the meeting later? Or should we just assume this will get picked up in the next meeting (3rd wednesday?)
[20:45] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; jnsgruk: I do not have the experience to advise presently on the next step from this failure. // Is your Launchpad contact link valid ?
[20:45] &lt;jnsgruk&gt; Yep all up to date
[20:47] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; jnsgruk: When I know more - I will so advise via the Launchpad link. OK  ?
[20:47] &lt;jnsgruk&gt; Sounds good, thanks
[20:48] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; jnsgruk: I do apologize on behalf of the board for this bad circumstance.
[20:48] &lt;jnsgruk&gt; No problem :)
[20:49] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; I too have chores to attend to - I will chack back in here later.
[20:49] &lt;jnsgruk&gt; Probably the best mode of contact is telegram -- I'm jnsgruk there too
[20:49] &lt;jnsgruk&gt; I can hang around until the meeting at 2200
[20:50] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; jnsgruk: I have no telegram client - or account. Perhaps others on the board do.

[02:07] &lt;blahdeblah&gt; Thanks for all your work on the xz backdoor mitigation stuff folks.  Anyone know whether it's likely to result in commits from pre-5.6 versions being rolled back?
[02:11] &lt;sarnold&gt; heya blahdeblah, afaik no decision has been made about that yet. rebuilding everything is pretty bloody expensive so I think we'd want something more concrete than trying to elide the attacker's account from the history entirely

[14:36] &lt;slyon&gt; *boom*
[14:36] &lt;sarnold&gt; oh my
[14:36] &lt;slyon&gt; I guess we should ignore that for today. I did some investigation ealier, and it's mostly due to missing binaries in the archive, cause by the mass-rebuild
[14:37] &lt;slyon&gt; then falling back to an alternative dependency, that is not in main
[14:37] &lt;sarnold&gt; ahhhhhh
[14:37] &lt;jbicha&gt; -proposed might be roughly correct though
[14:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hey, thanks for starting
[14:37] &lt;slyon&gt; gnome-remote-desktop -&gt; freerdp2 should be double checked, as we want it to use freerdp3 instead
[14:38] &lt;slyon&gt; jbicha: -proposed is even worse
[14:38] &lt;sarnold&gt; how is that worse? :)
[14:38] &lt;slyon&gt; I'm not sure where those new rust-* trees/roots come from, but would blame the state of the archive, too
[14:38] &lt;jbicha&gt; gnome-remote-desktop does depend on freerdp3 in -proposed but failed to build on armhf &amp; may need AA help
[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks jbicha, that will resolve the mismatch on freerdp2 then once it migrates
[14:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; what kind of AA help do you expect there?
[14:39] &lt;slyon&gt; sarnold: ah sorry! I mixed up my -release and -proposed tabs :)
[14:39] &lt;sarnold&gt; slyon: every single week I think we ought to switch the order of the two links and every single week I do nothing about it :)
[14:39] &lt;jbicha&gt; we may want to remove gnome-remote-desktop on armhf
[14:39] &lt;slyon&gt; abseil -&gt; googletest and glib2.0 -&gt; sysprof should be checked by the desktop team (cc didrocks, jbicha)
[14:39] &lt;jbicha&gt; oh removing armhf was already done so I guess that will clear up on xz-utils migrates
[14:40] &lt;jbicha&gt; I'm working through glib -&gt; sysprof either by reverting or by demoting libglib2.0-dev to universe (like we did with other sysprof-using libraries)
[14:40] &lt;jbicha&gt; Desktop plans to do a MIR for sysprof for the 24.10 cycle
[14:40] &lt;slyon&gt; I updated the *trace* and bpf* cases today and would love to get cpaelzer's input on bpf*, to see if we can drop some of the MIR required TODOs to Recommended TODOs. (but more on that later)
[14:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, so no dependency now - but re-added in 24.10 - sounds good and matches what I expected
[14:40] &lt;eslerm_&gt; thank you slyon :)

[14:48] &lt;sarnold&gt; it *is* very clean :D
[14:49] &lt;eslerm_&gt; \o/
[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; eslerm_ has done an excellent job helping many reviewers to help us get to this state :) I'm feeling really good. &lt;3
[14:49] &lt;dviererbe&gt; wow nearly empty board

[14:49] &lt;slyon&gt; Much appreciated, kudos!

[14:50] &lt;eslerm_&gt; the remaining items on Security's jira board are blocked
[14:50] &lt;slyon&gt; eslerm_: did you already reach out to the corresponding team to help unblocking it?
[14:51] &lt;eslerm_&gt; one is blocked by security
[14:51] &lt;eslerm_&gt; the other we have spoken to desktop about
[14:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; so, we weren't exactly clear in our "must be assigned to security team before beta freeze" if it was the specific date or the specific milestone .. and perhaps beta freeze has moved around due to the recent fun
[14:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; in any event, MIRs beyond beta freeze that need security team ACK will also need a conversation with the security engineering director
[14:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; I think that's all I had

[14:53] &lt;eslerm_&gt; the msgraph mir says it targets 24.04.1
[14:54] &lt;slyon&gt; thx cpaelzer! cc dviererbe ^
[14:54] &lt;slyon&gt; eslerm_: good. that should give some buffer
[14:54] &lt;slyon&gt; Do we have anything else?
[14:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: I'm ok on build time tests being impossible on bpftrace - with autopkgtests added that should be ok
[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; not that I feel to be the one that has to decide alone, but I think it is ok
[14:55] &lt;dviererbe&gt; Do I have to open an MIR bug for dotnet8?
[14:55] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: I agree. As we need a specific kernel, that we cannot guarantee on the builders
[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yep
[14:55] &lt;eslerm_&gt; it would be nice to sort out which bpf binaries make it to the default installation, lots of duplication between packages
[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm_: that is on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bpfcc/+bug/2052813
[14:56] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2052813 in bpfcc (Ubuntu) "[MIR] bpfcc" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm_: I think it will only pull in one of them, and IMHO should be the smallest (there are pre-linked and some that have way more dependencies)
[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; But I haven't done this myself, so I can't tell you what exactly it would pull atm
[14:57] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I cannot find my conversation about fdk-aac-free, I'll speak to desktop in case I did not :(
[14:57] &lt;eslerm_&gt; thanks cpaelzer
[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but we have seen it in the mismatches, so it is there isn't it
[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bpftrace/+bug/2052809 seems to be ready then
[14:57] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2052809 in bpftrace (Ubuntu) "[MIR] bpftrace" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[14:58] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: ACK. I'll update the case
[14:58] &lt;slyon&gt; what about bpfcc?
[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; alreaedy done
[14:58] &lt;slyon&gt; cool!
[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; still reading on this one
[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bpfcc/+bug/2052813
[14:58] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2052813 in bpfcc (Ubuntu) "[MIR] bpfcc" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[14:58] &lt;eslerm_&gt; personally, I would make the bpftrace binaries non-executable examples
[14:58] &lt;sarnold&gt; and I personally think that'd vastly detract from the value of the package :)
[14:59] &lt;eslerm_&gt; there are two packages in the bpfcc source package which duplicate binary functionality as well
[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think we should have the examples executable
[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is about making people aware of a whole new world of things they could get
[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm_: are you concerned about something in particular?
[14:59] &lt;sarnold&gt; the duplicated functionality in the bpfcc package feels pretty unfortunate :( some of them seem to work and others don't :( it'd be nice if the not-working-at-release ones would be removed..
[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: symbols have been looked at, the rest is done or impossible
[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that is usually the amount we strong-require
[15:00] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: so that can be promoted?
[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'd be ok to give it a pass, you are subscribed and might even add c++filt based symbsoils in the past
[15:00] &lt;eslerm_&gt; it just feels redundant to have execsnoop, execsnoop-bpfcc, and execsnoop.bt all installed by default (and many similar cases)
[15:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; again, you are all entitled to make that call - but I think yes this is ok'ishj
[15:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we might want to mention the "do not install all tools" that we discussed above
[15:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm_: yeah, not all of them for sure
[15:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm_: that is what I meant with just the set without dependencies
[15:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm_: whichever that was
[15:02] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I trust that it will be implemented well :)
[15:02] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; never trust :-)
[15:02] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but thanks
[15:03] &lt;slyon&gt; OK. I'll update the bpfcc case after the meeing then.
[15:03] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: May I also ask you to have a look at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libtraceevent/+bug/2051916/comments/22
[15:03] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2051916 in libtraceevent (Ubuntu) "[MIR] promote libtraceevent as a trace-cmd dependency" [Undecided, In Progress]
[15:03] &lt;slyon&gt; Do you want those #MISSING: symbols dropped? IMO it should be fine as-is. Upstream is aware and want's to drop it anyway
[15:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #MISSING is fine unless it keeps adding more and more and more of them
[15:04] &lt;slyon&gt; but we can also wait for didrocks opinion on this ^ as he was the original reviewer
[15:04] &lt;slyon&gt; ok
[15:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; you'd usually expect some cleanup every release or so
[15:05] &lt;sarnold&gt; distro release or package "release"?
[15:05] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; distro release
[15:05] &lt;sarnold&gt; ack
[15:06] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; like not each upload, but one of these usual "once every while" housekeeping tasks
[15:07] &lt;slyon&gt; I guess that should be all for today...
[15:07] &lt;slyon&gt; thanks all! o/
[15:07] &lt;eslerm_&gt; thanks for doing a final triage-review of all the bpf mirs slyon
[15:07] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: do you know which bpf tools are the small ones?
[15:07] &lt;eslerm_&gt; thanks all o/
[15:07] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: I don't know, but will check back with ravikant_
[15:08] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok found it
[15:08] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the dependency is
[15:08] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; 1. seeds changed to depend on ubuntu-kernel-accessories
[15:08] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; 2. that depends on
[15:08] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Recommends: bpfcc-tools, bpftrace
[15:08] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think that should actually be libbpf-tools
[15:08] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; which is the small one as in
[15:09] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; "
[15:09] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; 112  This package provides the tools from bpfcc-tools but written in a portable
[15:09] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; 113  fashion using BTF and libbpf hence the installation footprint will be smaller
[15:09] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; 114  compared to bpfcc-tools.
[15:09] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; "
[15:10] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'll ping Robie who was coordinating a lot
[15:10] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; you ping ravikant_
[15:10] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and together they will probably ask kernel to update the dependency or tell us why it needs to be the bigger one
[15:10] &lt;slyon&gt; sounds like a plan!
[15:11] &lt;dviererbe&gt; Repeating this question, because I am not sure if the answer was meant for me. Do I have to open an MIR bug for dotnet8? or is this included with the dotnet6 MIR?
[15:11] &lt;sarnold&gt; oh right .
[15:11] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; dviererbe: you'd want to open one, but refer to the existing dotnet6
[15:11] &lt;dviererbe&gt; ack
[15:11] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; dviererbe: and then spell out what is the same and what is different
[15:11] &lt;ravikant_&gt; thanks all! I am meeting Robie in 30 mins.
[15:11] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; dviererbe: so it should exist, but should be a fast path for both sides

[15:11] &lt;sarnold&gt; .. imho opening a new one would make sense; perhaps sometday it'll be as auto-pilot as postgres, but at least the first few it feels like it's worth having an eye on it
[15:12] &lt;dviererbe&gt; okay, thanks
[15:12] &lt;sarnold&gt; (we can all dream of someday being as good as postgres :)
[15:13] &lt;slyon&gt; Can I close the meeting now?
[15:15] &lt;slyon&gt; (sorry for running over again!)
[15:15] &lt;sarnold&gt; I think so, but I thought so a few minutes ago, too, hehe

[01:20] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; teward: sure, still available as a launchpad artifact here https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xz-utils/5.6.0-0.2/+build/27848538
[01:21] &lt;teward&gt; oh nice it's an RCE bug according to the deeper oss-security dive. Now i'm really curious what it's going to do.  *sets up a full system auditor too*
[01:23] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: wasn't sure if we were going to have the artifacts yanked either, but at least I can start having fun watching in the sandbox of a research lab what this does.  Analysis by others is nice, but sometimes I want to see what it does myself.

[11:13] &lt;tomreyn&gt; from what i understand, snap packages are not in your domain (my info may be outdated). and while most snaps run in containment, someone should probably check for embedded xz-utils copies.
[11:20] &lt;JanC&gt; mostly liblzma* then probably
[11:49] &lt;tomreyn&gt; might also impact the new desktop installer (snap), which is based on flutter, which depends on xz-utils.

[16:40] &lt;JanC&gt; ugh, just seeing this... https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4
[16:42] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; yeah, not fun
[16:42] &lt;JanC&gt; doesn't impact Ubuntu fortunately
[16:45] &lt;JanC&gt; looks like that was a new contributor who did translation updates originally...
[16:47] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; yeah, I wonder if this is the first time I've seen a malicious contributor playing the long game
[16:47] &lt;JanC&gt; not a very long game
[16:47] &lt;JanC&gt; they mighthave started a couple weeks after those initial translation commits
[16:48] &lt;JanC&gt; in fact, after a couple _days_
[16:49] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; huh? they have been contributing for a year or so
[16:49] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; here's nov 2022 https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commits?author=JiaT75&amp;since=2022-11-01&amp;until=2022-12-01
[16:50] &lt;JanC&gt; oh, right, I wasn't looking far enough
[16:50] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; there are others before that
[16:51] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; JanC: also, it did make it's way into noble-proposed, we're still investigating
[16:51] &lt;JanC&gt; oh
[16:51] &lt;JanC&gt; I'd only looked at packages.ubuntu.com
[16:52] &lt;JanC&gt; which doesn't include -proposed  :)
[16:53] &lt;JanC&gt; that person was removed from xz project I see
[16:55] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; hrm, you sure?
[16:56] &lt;JanC&gt; oh, he wasn't
[16:56] &lt;JanC&gt; or she
[16:57] &lt;JanC&gt; man, GitHub UI is so confusing
[16:57] &lt;JanC&gt; they seem to have commits in libarchive also: https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Alibarchive%2Flibarchive+JiaT75&amp;type=commits
[16:57] &lt;JanC&gt; well merge requests
[16:58] &lt;JanC&gt; that seem to be committed
[16:58] &lt;JanC&gt; might be worth investigating those too?
[17:01] &lt;JanC&gt; although that was in 2021, so probably part of the "long game"?
[17:03] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; yeah, nothing particularly sticks out there
[17:08] &lt;JanC&gt; so possibly other things than sshd might be affected too
=== arraybolt3 is now known as arraybolt3-dange
=== arraybolt3-dange is now known as arraybolt3-cmp
[19:29] &lt;teward&gt; is Noble affected by the xz vuln?  It's been in Unstable for a little while now if I'm reading OpenWall's analysis
[19:29] &lt;teward&gt; also I assume 22.04 LTS and such are not affected
[19:30] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; teward: it was in noble-proposed, we removed it, we're currently investigating what else we need to do to noble
[19:30] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; (if anything)
[19:30] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: tactical nuke / rebuild of anything that used xz libraries sounds prudent
[19:30] &lt;teward&gt; but i know that may not be feasible (insert builder issues here)
[19:30] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; teward: smarter people than me are looking into it
[19:30] &lt;teward&gt; good good
[19:31] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: but none of the already released releases are affected?
[19:31] &lt;teward&gt; i.e. LTS, etc.
[19:31] &lt;teward&gt; s/LTS/current LTS/
[19:31] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; no, noble only
[19:31] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; no released ubuntu versions are affected
[19:32] &lt;teward&gt; check, just making sure
[19:39] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: not sure if it's necessary, but Debian has 5.6.1+really5.4.5-1 or higher i think because of this discovery.  So it's something to keep an eye on.
[19:39] &lt;teward&gt; JanC: if I read the Openwall stuff, SystemD might be impacted by anything in liblzma and such, so it's something that the smarter people need to look at
[19:39] &lt;teward&gt; (yes i am reading scrollback)
[19:43] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; teward: yeah, we just removed it since it was still in noble-proposed, but debian had it all the way to testing, so publishing an update was required
[19:43] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: was anything released from -proposed since the first-affected version from Debian was introduced?
[19:44] &lt;teward&gt; I'm assuming *no* because that'd probably be a 'Held because xz-utils, etc. not OK'd"
[19:44] &lt;teward&gt; so just doing due diligence asking some questions (forgive if they seem a little stupid)
[19:46] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; teward: that is what is under investigation
[19:46] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: ack.
[19:46] &lt;teward&gt; any chance there'll be a major notice on -devel or such if some kind of thing is discovered about this, sort of a post-incident thing?
[19:47] &lt;teward&gt; and by 'on devel' i mean the mailing list or discourse or something
[19:48] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; I assume so, but I'm not the person working on that

[15:12] &lt;bdmurray&gt; vorlon: Should we drop the `all-proposed` changes to britney and autopkgtest-cloud now?
[15:12] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I mean the forcing of all-proposed.
[15:13] &lt;vorlon&gt; bdmurray: yes, due to pytest being broken in -proposed. I left that to juliank to sort out with the QA Team overnight, but I guess he didn't :)
[15:13] &lt;adrien&gt; well, he's officially off
[15:14] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon: We have prepped the merges for it, but I left final decision to sil2100

[15:17] &lt;vorlon&gt; also not clear it applies to noble at all?
[15:18] &lt;blackboxsw&gt; I also have a question about whether we shoud treat https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/needrestart/+bug/2059337 as rls-incoming? hence my dropping into the call today.

[15:18] &lt;vorlon&gt; blackboxsw: you should tag rls-nn-incoming anything that you want to escalate to the corresponding engineering team for consideration
[15:19] &lt;vorlon&gt; anyway I'll say we should take that one
[15:19] &lt;blackboxsw&gt; +1 thanks , wanted a pre-flight check before I do. will do I'm uncertain about whether this is a default behavior that'll affect a any package/script which invokes apt upgradedist-upgrade and happens the be targetted for needrestart operation. :)
[15:19] &lt;vorlon&gt; tagging it foundations-todo now
[15:19] &lt;blackboxsw&gt; thank you
[15:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; blackboxsw: "any package/script" - it looks at systemd units
[15:21] &lt;blackboxsw&gt; ahh, limits my concern a bit then. but still a potentially broad net of services which we may or may not know about.

[15:24] &lt;schopin&gt; fairly regular activity on it, though.
[15:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; yeah but if it's been open for 3 years already I don't think we should prioritize it
[15:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; also the systemd task is incomplete and the snapd task is open
[15:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; I think we should leave this as-is and maybe ping snapd team about it

[15:39] &lt;mateus-morais&gt; I'm out tomorrow, but I'm here on monday
[15:39] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I also heard upgrading to Noble now is a bad idea?
[15:39] &lt;dviererbe&gt; I am out tomorrow &amp; monday too
[15:39] &lt;mclemenceau&gt; I'll be here friday / monday
[15:39] &lt;schopin&gt; bdmurray: referring to https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2024-March/042954.html I guess?
[15:40] &lt;slyon&gt; you beat me to it :)
[15:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; schopin: the report is regenerated but not visible until rsync
[15:47] &lt;vorlon&gt; is the meeting over?
[15:47] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I think so

[13:44] &lt;ahasenack&gt; he ubuntu apparmor profile files usually have an include statement at the end, to allow for local customizations in the /etc/apparmor.d/local/&lt;name&gt; file
[13:44] &lt;ahasenack&gt; but some profiles define child profiles
[13:44] &lt;ahasenack&gt; I don't see include statements for these child profiles, and that would also not work with dh_apparmor because it only cares about the profile name, assuming that one file defines only one profile
[13:45] &lt;ahasenack&gt; I guess this is an open question/issue then? We don't have a way to allow for local customizations of child profiles, defined inside a profile?
[13:46] &lt;ahasenack&gt; like this scenario: https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/bDgk4g3Q33/
[13:47] &lt;ahasenack&gt; profile foo could be adapted via new config in local/foo (but not override explicit DENYs it might have, AIUI)
[13:47] &lt;ahasenack&gt; but pofiles bar, ugh, and another, cannot be adapted
[13:49] &lt;georgiag&gt; i guess you could add "include &lt;local/foobar&gt;" under profile bar
[13:51] &lt;georgiag&gt; but yeah, that has not been done. I'm not sure if that's something just out of my head but I always saw child profiles as self contained so I didn't find it weird it didn't allow for customizations
[13:55] &lt;ahasenack&gt; yeah, they are usually tailored to how the main application is calling the other executables, and not meant as a general profile
[13:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; for example, I have a dpkg child profile, and I'm 100% sure it would not be applicable as a general dpkg profile
[13:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; because I only care about how my app calls dpkg, and it's never in a "install a package for me" mode
[13:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; so the child profile is much simpler, and tighter
[13:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; but there could be bugs
[13:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; I guess I'm seeing this include from local as a way to work around bugs in the profile without having to change the main config file
[14:00] &lt;georgiag&gt; ah right. I don't see local as a way to fix bugs. like for example if I want to compile my own qemu and have libvirt point to my own qemu instead, I would add it to local/usr.sbin.libvirtd. or having a config file in a non-default place and allowing it in the local profile, etc. the end result is the same
[14:01] &lt;ahasenack&gt; well, one classical case of local overrides is home directories
[14:01] &lt;ahasenack&gt; a home dir doesn't have to be in /home/$user :)
[14:01] &lt;ahasenack&gt; classic snap complaint, btw
[14:09] &lt;georgiag&gt; yep, thats true!

[15:35] &lt;slyon&gt; bpf* Got security ACK. Needs double-checking by cpaelzer to validate the MIR remarks are resolved

[15:39] &lt;seb128&gt; slyon, I think we need an upload of ubuntu-desktop which didn't happen yet

[15:44] &lt;slyon&gt; libmail-dmarc-perl is an interesting one.
[15:45] &lt;eslerm_&gt; Security is aiming to complete a review for libemail-mime-perl by Thursday
[15:45] &lt;slyon&gt; eslerm_: That's great. thanks!
[15:45] &lt;eslerm_&gt; unless using libmail-dmarc-perl as packaged in proposed is preferred
[15:45] &lt;slyon&gt; The only thing remaining IIUC would be the duplication issue: libemail-mime-perl &amp; libmime-tools-perl in main
[15:46] &lt;slyon&gt; well well... I don't know. We can make a call between duplicated work because of two similar packages in "main". Or extra work because of carrying non-mainstream patches.
[15:46] &lt;sarnold&gt; one of the comments on https://github.com/msimerson/mail-dmarc/pull/217 suggested that the original requirements are also requirements for spamassassin 4.0, so suddenly it feels more plausible to use the original requirements..
[15:46] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Pull 217 in msimerson/mail-dmarc "use MIME::Entity and MIME::Parser from MIME::Tools instead of Email::MIME" [Open]
[15:47] &lt;slyon&gt; I don't know what's better and would like to deferr that call to the server team, as they own both of those packages.
[15:47] &lt;slyon&gt; (CC cpaelzer ^)
[15:48] &lt;slyon&gt; sarnold: that suggests we should be using libemail-mime-perl after all?
[15:48] &lt;sarnold&gt; slyon: yeah. it's a complex choice.
[15:49] &lt;slyon&gt; I'll update the case on LP, as I'd like to wait for server-team input
[15:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; I was really impressed with mirespace's patch to switch out the dependencies, it looked ideal, but then it felt like we'll eventually need the original packages "soon" anyway..
[15:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; sounds good
[15:52]  * slyon commented
[15:52] &lt;slyon&gt; bug #2015538
[15:52] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2015538 in dbus-broker (Ubuntu) "[MIR] dbus-broker" [Undecided, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2015538
[15:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; oh lots of conversation since I last looked
[15:53] &lt;slyon&gt; turns out there is a hard dependency between dbus-run-session and dbus-daemon. So we cannot do a simple package split
[15:53] &lt;slyon&gt; So this needs to be postponed to next cycle, as we need extra engineering time to come up with a solution.
[15:54] &lt;slyon&gt; eslerm_: can you clarify your comment on bug #2056099 ?
[15:54] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2056099 in tree (Ubuntu) "[MIR] tree" [Undecided, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2056099
[15:54] &lt;slyon&gt; Are you saying we don't need security ACK for NN promotion?
[15:55] &lt;eslerm_&gt; this might explain best: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nbd/+bug/2054480/comments/7
[15:55] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2054480 in nbd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] nbd-client" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:55] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I just wanted to note these for future cycles
[15:56] &lt;slyon&gt; I understand for nbd, which was in main for a long time and probably never got security review.
[15:57] &lt;slyon&gt; but for src:tree it's a new decision, no?
[15:57] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I'll leave it to Seth if Security wants to review
[15:58] &lt;slyon&gt; Oh! It's because of the MIR assessment: "This does not need a security review"
[15:58] &lt;eslerm_&gt; yes :)
[15:58] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I'm not saying we need to review these for NN
[15:58] &lt;slyon&gt; joalif: is that something you'd be willing to change for the "tree" MIR?
[15:58] &lt;slyon&gt; ok
[15:58] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I just don't want it to be a pattern for OO
[15:58] &lt;slyon&gt; joalif: nvm :)
[15:59] &lt;slyon&gt; Well it's always a hard call for us MIR reviewers, as we don't have a security background. But we try to rather be safe and ask for security-review if in doubt
[16:00] &lt;sarnold&gt;   register void *value = malloc (size);
[16:00] &lt;eslerm_&gt; it's understandable :pray:
[16:00] &lt;sarnold&gt; oh wow this thing is *ancient* :)
[16:01] &lt;sarnold&gt; at least it's using ansi c prototypes, but 'register', I haven't seen that in live code in ages, hehe
[16:01] &lt;slyon&gt; eslerm_: sarnold: If you have bad feelings about security-review bypassing of a specific package, please always reach out to the MIR reviewer. We might not always be aware of the side-effects.
[16:02] &lt;eslerm_&gt; ++1
[16:02] &lt;sarnold&gt; ack, thanks slyon
[16:02] &lt;slyon&gt; ok. I left a quick comments on the "tree" MIR, as it's still lacking tests
[16:02] &lt;slyon&gt; moving on..
[16:02] &lt;slyon&gt; bug #2054480

[16:04] &lt;slyon&gt; I'd like to get didrocks opinion on nbd-client, to see if his concerns are resolved.

[16:04] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2048781 in authd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] authd" [Undecided, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2048781
[16:04] &lt;eslerm_&gt; very nice add to authd didrocks :)
[16:05] &lt;slyon&gt; Here Didier added a ncie "cargo-vendor-filterer" tool, to get rid of windows* crates during package build
[16:05] &lt;slyon&gt; I think this is a good approach for now, until we can come up with a centralized solution
[16:06] &lt;slyon&gt; pending security review.

[20:11] &lt;seb128&gt; thanks rbasak, an efficient meeting!
[20:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; yw!
[20:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; amurray, vorlon in particular, but also maybe relevant for the others: note that the agenda states "London time" and so the next meeting will be presumably in DST and therefore will shift relative to UTC.
[20:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; (is that correct?)
[20:19] &lt;vorlon&gt; yes that will be helpful to me, I currently have a conflict with a standup ):
[20:19] &lt;vorlon&gt; :)
[20:19] &lt;vorlon&gt; (because of the US already switching)
[20:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; taking aac-tactics
[20:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; heh
[20:34] &lt;amurray&gt; yep I'll try to remember to wake up an hour earlier next time
[20:35] &lt;amurray&gt; oh it will be 2 hours earlier since DST ends here too

# UBUNTU-MEETING

[00:25] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Two questions. One, what is "device slack" in the output of `btrfs fi usage`? Secondly, why in all of creation is it seen as 16 **exabytes** if I run it without root on my meager 6TB HDD?
[00:25] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I may be a slight data hoarder but I haven't gone that crazy yet :P
[00:26] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (when I run it with sudo it shows up as 0 bytes, which ironically is the opposite extreme but that's beside the point)
[00:55] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; lol, I posted this in the wrong channel

[10:36] &lt;SvenKieske&gt; Hi there, anybody does care about the recent python vulns disclosed? 2 days ago but I don't find any information on updates or even a public bugtracker entry? e.g. CVE-2024-0450 https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu?field.searchtext=CVE-2024-0450&amp;search=Search&amp;field.status%3Alist=NEW&amp;field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&amp;field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&amp;field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&amp;field.

[10:36] &lt;SvenKieske&gt; sorry for the broken link, launchpad search links are really long it seems. but you get the idea. search for the cve...nothing found on all of launchpad
[10:37] &lt;SvenKieske&gt; for reference: https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2024/q1/240
[10:39] &lt;SvenKieske&gt; I honestly would have assumed that at least a bugreport is open at canonical, or maybe even updates, for a package managed by ubuntu core? :-/ seems people are really busy then.
[11:58] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; SvenKieske: that info just cam out yesterday, you'll need to wait for a few days for it to show up in our tracker and for us to triage it
[12:00] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; I'll manually add them to our tracker now instead of waiting for our usual CVE feeds

[15:03] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 15:03:05 UTC.  The chair is juliank.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

[15:08] &lt;bdrung&gt; waveform, `eval "$(grep "^VERSION_CODENAME=" /etc/os-release)"` can be just changed to `. /etc/os-release`
[15:09] &lt;waveform&gt; it could... but it just feels a bit "dirty" to me :)
[15:10] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Less dirty than that ^^
[15:10] &lt;juliank&gt; quite tricky that os-release
[15:10] &lt;adrien&gt; you could do that in a subshell and echo the appropriate value too
[15:10] &lt;juliank&gt; You definitely need a subshell
[15:10] &lt;bdrung&gt; waveform, the os-release spec says that it is shell sourceable
[15:11] &lt;juliank&gt; i.e. we needed to do +GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`( . /etc/os-release; echo ${NAME:-@DPKG_VENDOR@} ) 2&gt;/dev/null || echo @DPKG_VENDOR@`
[15:11] &lt;waveform&gt; sure, but do I want to trawl the spec and make certain it can't clobber any existing vars I've got in the env or do I just want to cherry pick the one I'm interested in?
[15:12] &lt;juliank&gt; The shell just aborts entirely if sourcing os-release fails, hence the need for the subshell
[15:12] &lt;juliank&gt; i.e. we don't trust it's always readable
[15:13] &lt;juliank&gt; users mess up stuff but breaking boot for it would be ugh
[15:13] &lt;juliank&gt; "But I want my system to identify itself as Foobar OS 25.564.53"!
[15:13] &lt;juliank&gt; Anyway, it's getting late, we should move on :)
[15:13] &lt;bdmurray&gt; "users mess up stuff" &lt;- truer words were never said
[15:13] &lt;bdrung&gt; but in this case it is an autopkgtest and it would be fine to fail if os-release contains garbage

[15:14] &lt;juliank&gt; bug http://launchpad.net/bugs/2054343
[15:14] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2054343 in gcc-10 (Ubuntu) "arm64 build of gcc-10 10.5.0-3ubuntu1 still broken (CVE-2023-4039 still open)" [Wishlist, Confirmed]
[15:14] &lt;juliank&gt; This is the only bug today!
[15:15] &lt;juliank&gt; This needs to be fixed in focal as it is in main
[15:15] &lt;juliank&gt; In all other releases it is in universe, so it's up to the ESM team to deliver a fix to esm-app-security
[15:15] &lt;Skia&gt; there is one in unknown that may be foundations too: bug 2058227
[15:15] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2058227 in apt-xapian-index (Ubuntu) "Crash during upgrade from Mantic to Noble due to Python 3.12" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2058227
[15:17] &lt;juliank&gt; Wait am I right in counting, is focal still in standard support?
=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk
[15:17] &lt;waveform&gt; yup
[15:17] &lt;waveform&gt; focal's still supported
[15:17]  * waveform eyes his home server still running focal...
[15:18] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; yeah, have been running JDK compliance tests for focal :D
[15:18] &lt;bdmurray&gt; a-x-i is only in main for trusty
[15:18] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I imagine the fix is simple though but is that package even useful? it was last updated in Focal
[15:20] &lt;juliank&gt; OK so what I did for gcc-10 is add focal task, change jj, mm to wontfix and said that's a Pro thing
[15:20] &lt;juliank&gt; Oh but probably it should be split into a FTBFS bug and a security one
[15:21] &lt;juliank&gt; Left the bug :)
[15:26] &lt;juliank&gt; So what's the conclusion on the apt-xapian-index one?
[15:26] &lt;juliank&gt; where does the crash even happen?
[15:26] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I think we should add a quirk to stop the service from running during the upgrade.
[15:26] &lt;bdmurray&gt; It happens during a dist-upgrade of Kubuntu.
[15:27] &lt;juliank&gt; We probably should have a quirk to inhibit all systemd timers and cron jobs
[15:27] &lt;juliank&gt; Probably should add a feature to systemd to actually inhibit timers
[15:27] &lt;juliank&gt; But that'S 25.04 talk
[15:28] &lt;mkukri&gt; cant something like this also happen if an already running service pulls in new stuff dynamically?
[15:28] &lt;juliank&gt; sure
[15:29] &lt;juliank&gt; Possibly atomic A/B upgrades are also a topic for 25.04
[15:29] &lt;juliank&gt; But need cooperating file system with snapshots
[15:30] &lt;juliank&gt; And figuring out how to upgrade snaps inside the new target
[15:30] &lt;schopin&gt; 25.04 we said, juliank, not right now ;)
[15:30] &lt;bdmurray&gt; time is short
[15:30] &lt;juliank&gt; heh
[15:30] &lt;juliank&gt; #topic Team proposed-migration report
[15:30] &lt;juliank&gt; #link https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs
[15:31] &lt;juliank&gt; I don't really want to assign anything particularly much, there's so much flux and it's hard to figure out what is not time_t and we should work on time_t first anyhow?
[15:32] &lt;juliank&gt; Well we can assign any non-armhf failures
[15:32] &lt;juliank&gt; Because they block progress and are clearly not time_t armhf bugs ;)
[15:33]  * juliank finds last week's assignments
[15:34] &lt;juliank&gt; Apparently Skia is still on libbsd migration but only one armhf task left hooray
[15:34] &lt;Skia&gt; yes, and it should probably be done shortly after the gvmd upload from this afternoon
[15:35] &lt;juliank&gt; libapt-pkg-perl
[15:36] &lt;juliank&gt; liushuyu: bdrung - supposed to have freetype but that seems cleared?
[15:36] &lt;juliank&gt; sigh
[15:36] &lt;juliank&gt; libapt-pkg-perl: bdrung? you're supposed to have freetype but that seems cleared?
[15:36] &lt;ginggs&gt; i had libapt-pkg-perl the previous week
[15:37] &lt;bdrung&gt; juliank, i'll be on vacation next week. so please skip me.
[15:37] &lt;juliank&gt; ok
[15:37] &lt;ginggs&gt; i sync'd the fix from debian, just waiting for tests
[15:37] &lt;juliank&gt; ginggs: There is no libapt-pkg assignment in the epic from last week
[15:37] &lt;juliank&gt; but good
[15:37] &lt;ginggs&gt; previous week
[15:38] &lt;juliank&gt; ack
[15:38] &lt;juliank&gt; python-apt is mine
[15:39] &lt;juliank&gt; waiting for tests I suppose
[15:39] &lt;juliank&gt; I don't see my test requests on the package page but I did them
[15:39] &lt;juliank&gt; will check /running later
[15:40] &lt;juliank&gt; apt vs xz-utils is with upils
[15:40] &lt;upils&gt; well, this is a time_t related issue AFAIU
[15:41] &lt;upils&gt; so I cannot really do anything about it except waiting for the -all-proposed run, no?
[15:41] &lt;juliank&gt; if you queued one then yeah
[15:41] &lt;adrien_web&gt; I did: they're not helpful
[15:41] &lt;juliank&gt; libtirpc was with liushuyu, there are no failures, but it doesn't migrate; someone to dig at update_output.txt?
[15:41] &lt;upils&gt; I did but It may have been lost at some point, I will check again
[15:41] &lt;juliank&gt; possibly needs hinting
[15:42] &lt;adrien_web&gt; Britney lags but updated an hour ago luckily
[15:43] &lt;liushuyu&gt; juliank: libtirpc is still waiting on the excuses to update (the last test just passed several hours ago)
[15:43] &lt;juliank&gt; no
[15:44] &lt;juliank&gt; hmm
[15:44] &lt;juliank&gt; maybe yes but excuses by teams doesn't show
[15:44] &lt;liushuyu&gt; "Migration status for libtirpc (1.3.4+ds-1build1 to 1.3.4+ds-1.1): Waiting for test results, another package or too young (no action required now - check later)"
[15:44] &lt;juliank&gt; ok
[15:44]  * adrien_web only looks at not by team
[15:44] &lt;juliank&gt; libuv1 is with mwhudson
[15:44] &lt;juliank&gt; adrien_web: heh but we need to look at by team one here
[15:45] &lt;juliank&gt; xz-utils is still with zhsj waiting for tests to run I suppose
[15:45] &lt;adrien_web&gt; I did retries for it, i think they're maybe all good now
[15:45] &lt;adrien_web&gt; For libuv
[15:45] &lt;juliank&gt; optipng is with bdmurray still
[15:46] &lt;juliank&gt; slang2 is with  tim andersson whatever his handle is, I don't know right know :)
[15:46] &lt;adrien_web&gt; juliank: yeah; I wanted to give more context to what I say
[15:46] &lt;juliank&gt; nfs-utils is with danilogondolfo still
[15:46] &lt;Skia&gt; andersson123, usually, but he's not online right now it seems
[15:47] &lt;juliank&gt; fwupd vs libmbim is with pushkarnk
[15:47] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; fwupd - waiting for results on amd64/armhf, tests pass locally. Failures on s390x need some investigation
[15:47] &lt;juliank&gt; This really should unlock all the fwupd vs *
[15:49] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; (actually, I can't repro the fwupd test failures on s390x locally, the tests seem to pass)
[15:49] &lt;juliank&gt; glib2.0 blocking *: waveform
[15:49] &lt;waveform&gt; ack
[15:50] &lt;juliank&gt; Let's skip a couple which only fail on armhf and get more interesting one
[15:50] &lt;bdmurray&gt; In the past there were network issues with fwupd
[15:50] &lt;juliank&gt; babeltrace is blocked by ceph, but due to dependency issues, but on amd64!
[15:50] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; bdmurray: ack, will check from that angle
[15:51] &lt;juliank&gt; babeltrace: dviererbe (previous week assignment seems solved)
[15:52] &lt;bdmurray&gt; being more specific issues with fwupd trying to access external resources
[15:52] &lt;dviererbe&gt; nice, but I did nothing
[15:52] &lt;juliank&gt; debhelper: Skia you wanna take those?
[15:52] &lt;Skia&gt; sure
[15:52] &lt;juliank&gt; It's 6 packages failing but hmm
[15:53] &lt;juliank&gt; dwz ginggs
[15:53] &lt;ginggs&gt; ack
[15:53] &lt;juliank&gt; libnsl slyon
[15:54] &lt;slyon&gt; ok
[15:54] &lt;juliank&gt; gdbm itself: mkukri
[15:54] &lt;mkukri&gt; ack
[15:55] &lt;juliank&gt; file, primarily non-armhf ones: mateus-morais
[15:55] &lt;mateus-morais&gt; juliank: ack
[15:57] &lt;juliank&gt; zlib has a bunch of dependency issues across non-armhf architectures: pushkarnk (please ping if you need assistance)
[15:58] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; ack
[15:58] &lt;juliank&gt; zlib non-armhf ones: schopin
[15:58] &lt;schopin&gt; isn't it what you just assigned?
[15:58] &lt;juliank&gt; oops
[15:59] &lt;juliank&gt; Let me wait until I find a bigger one for you
[15:59] &lt;schopin&gt; erm... OK?
[15:59] &lt;juliank&gt; gsasl blocking iproute2: liushuyu
[15:59] &lt;liushuyu&gt; juliank: okay
[16:00] &lt;juliank&gt; initramfs-tools: So bdrung wants none, so maybe schopin wants that one
[16:00] &lt;juliank&gt; It's s390x!
[16:00] &lt;bdrung&gt; i'll take care of initramfs-tools
[16:01] &lt;bdrung&gt; all those failures should be fixed with the latest uploads

=== JanC_ is now known as JanC
[16:02] &lt;juliank&gt; libpng1.6: schopin
[16:02] &lt;juliank&gt; but like maybe focus on the one arm64
[16:02] &lt;juliank&gt; and the i386
[16:02]  * schopin looks around for someone else to jump in.
[16:02] &lt;schopin&gt; ACK.

# UBUNTU-MEETING

[15:30] &lt;sarnold&gt; good morning
[15:31] &lt;eslerm_&gt; o/
[15:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hiho
[15:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; just 1 more minute to get started
[15:32] &lt;slyon&gt; o/
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok
[15:34] &lt;jbicha&gt; o/
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; rush ...

[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic current component mismatches
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #link https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/component-mismatches-proposed.svg

[15:34] &lt;jamespage&gt; o/
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we see the known set ot trace*
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; then the unsurprising long case of jaraco
[15:35] &lt;slyon&gt; freerdp3 seems new and needs investigation by the desktop team (cc didrocks)
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; will that ever chance jamespage?
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ack on freerdp3
[15:35] &lt;jamespage&gt; I need to refresh my brain on why that's still there
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; jbicha: you said hi, do you happen to know any more on freerdp3?
[15:35] &lt;jamespage&gt; oh right this was todo with pydantic
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and also for jamespage there is python-openstacksdk -&gt; platformdirs
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but is filed
[15:36] &lt;eslerm_&gt; libtraceevent is being worked on by security, libtracefs was deemed to not need security review. should be good to go
[15:36] &lt;jbicha&gt; yes, Ubuntu Desktop would like to do a straight swap: freerdp3 for freerdp2. It has 2 main reverse dependencies, gnome-remote-desktop &amp; remmina and both have been switched in noble-proposed
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; waiting for an assigneed
[15:36] &lt;jamespage&gt; it is just needs someone other than me (who filed it) to review
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; jbicha: ok, is freerdp3 based ont he source of freerdp2 or something completely else?
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes jamespage we will get to that when looking at tasks to assign - thanks
[15:37] &lt;slyon&gt; eslerm_: *trace* still needs some work from foundations, primarly to enable tests
[15:37] &lt;jbicha&gt; cpaelzer: it is a new upstream version of the same project. It just will take a while for everything in universe to be ported
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: yes some QA is also what I've seen the most there - also on bpf*
[15:37] &lt;joalif&gt; o/
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: but all of it moves and I have hopes it works out
[15:37] &lt;jbicha&gt; the new source package idea was also done years ago when freerdp2 was introduced
[15:37] &lt;slyon&gt; ack
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; jbicha: so will we need both in the archive or both in main for a transition time?
[15:38] &lt;jbicha&gt; cpaelzer: both are only needed in main for the short (lol) time it will take for things to get out of noble-proposed
[15:39] &lt;jbicha&gt; freerdp2 will not be needed in main for 24.04 LTS
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, I think you can craft a bug until next week
[15:39] &lt;slyon&gt; basicaly demote freedrp2 &amp; promote freerdp3 IIUC
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and if it is indeed the same and not hilariously bad (and slipped into main in the dark past) then it should be a quick case
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; 10 reverse dependencies
[15:40] &lt;jbicha&gt; cpaelzer: so you want an explicit MIR bug for freerdp3?
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; is there an old one we could tag this on to?
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; from freerdp2
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and OTOH this is kind of a lib transition, there release team might want to talk about an FFE - up to you to judge
[15:41] &lt;jbicha&gt; bug 673925

[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; great
[15:42] &lt;sarnold&gt; heh kees sure has a way with words :) "it implies a grievous lack of attention to security"
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; all testing off makes me wonder
[15:42] &lt;slyon&gt; jbicha: freerdp3 has no autopkgtests :(
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;     -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF in build
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; nothing in debian/tests/
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ...
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sure we could say it is as bad as before, but I'm feeling not too happy
[15:43] &lt;eslerm_&gt; is the need for freerdp2 related to fdk-aac-free?
[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think it is ok to say yes, as nothing will regress. But I feel bad to let this opportuinty to add some QA be added :-/
[15:44] &lt;jbicha&gt; eslerm_: not directly, but gnome-remote-desktop (and a a few others) want fdk-aac*
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this isn't a dictatorship - how do others feel. Passing as "same content new name and version" or passing with "yes, but add some tests before promotion" ?
[15:45] &lt;seb128&gt; (sorry in a call at the same time but I'm happy to commit desktop team time to improve tests/packaging before the end of the cycle if that can help to unblock things)
[15:45] &lt;jbicha&gt; cpaelzer: I can add some bugs and Jira cards for exploring enabling freerdp tests. Unfortunately things are so busy I don't think we have capacity before noble's release
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks seb128, that is all I wanted - you gave jbicha the time to have a look
[15:46] &lt;slyon&gt; +1 on implementing at least a basic set of tests, if that is an option
[15:48] &lt;sarnold&gt; another possibility if it's just too hard to test during build or too fickle to test during autopkgtest is the 'manual testing plan' and assurances that it'd be run on every update; we haven't done this in a while, is it still an option or did we push strongly enough for fully automated testing that we removed the manual testing plan?
[15:48] &lt;jbicha&gt; eslerm_: I believe the takeaway on fdk-aac-free was "No for 24.04 LTS, can re-evaluate later to check for improvement in security handling"
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I write a bug update ...
[15:48] &lt;sarnold&gt; if upstream has already abandoned the older versions, it'd be unfun to stick on it for the next ten years vs this one, which might be replaced by freerdp4 in another five or so :)
[15:49] &lt;jbicha&gt; sarnold: oh, I have a minimal manual test plan for both Remmina &amp; gnome-remote-desktop https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/TestPlans/RemoteDesktop

[15:50] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2057842 in remmina (Ubuntu) "FFe: [MIR] freedp2 -&gt; freerdp3 in main" [Undecided, Fix Committed]
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I hope that is ok as the compromise we found here
[15:50] &lt;eslerm_&gt; jbicha: if fdk-aac-free is causing the change from freerdp3 to freerdp2, please message me. The security tradeoff is likely better with 3. The chain to upstream needs to be improved for fdk-aac
[15:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; jbicha: nice, thanks
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; wow, time flies
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic New MIRs

[15:50] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2057683 in platformdirs (Ubuntu) "[MIR] platformdirs" [High, New]
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm ok to give this a shot
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; as relax task between roadmaps
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and I haven#t done one in two weeks
[15:51] &lt;jbicha&gt; eslerm_: fdk-aac-free isn't needed for the freerdp3 switch. Thank you
[15:51] &lt;eslerm_&gt; ack, +1
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; next is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/2058192
[15:51] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2058192 in ubuntu "[MIR][needs-packaging] lenovo-wwan-unlock" [Wishlist, New]
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; which looks ... unfinished?
[15:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; it sure feels like we've already got something for the xdg directory names thingy
[15:52] &lt;sarnold&gt;   - Binary configservice_lenovo and DPR_Fcc_unlock_service in /opt/fcc_lenovo/ is no problem because AppArmor constraints applied
[15:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; well that's sure iffy
[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; lenovo-wwan-unlock being not yet even in universe makes us lack and history on quuality
[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the link has no code, no build
[15:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; I realize our OEM stuff can be weird but this feels too weird, or it's in the wrong place, or something like that
[15:53] &lt;slyon&gt; just a PPA build in https://launchpad.net/~dirksu/+archive/ubuntu/fccunlock-test
[15:54] &lt;slyon&gt; But I agree this should go through normal review &amp; sponsorship into multiverse first
[15:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hmm
[15:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; incomplete for now
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; until it at least is in the archive
[15:56] &lt;sarnold&gt; can we give our coworker some concrete advice on a next step?
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah, but I wonder what that is other than get it in the archive
[15:56] &lt;sarnold&gt; I strongly dislike the idea of us packaging *anything* in /opt
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;  - debian/watch is not present because it is a native package and need to add
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ??
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that is not mutually excludive
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; exclusive
[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; has canonical-mainstream ever owned a package
[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I might have missed them since it is OEM work
[15:57] &lt;slyon&gt; Maybe a next step could be reaching out to ~ubuntu-sponsors to get it reviewed and sponsored into the archive?
[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/m-r-package-team-mapping.html#canonical-mainstream
[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yep ok
[15:57] &lt;slyon&gt; I remember other canonical-mainstream bugs from the sponsorhip queue
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: that is a good suggestion
[15:58] &lt;slyon&gt; I can write a comment
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; already on it
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; done

[16:02] &lt;eslerm_&gt; Security is aiming to clear our currently assigned board this week so that we are available for last minute requests
[16:02] &lt;eslerm_&gt; please assign platformdirs and lenovo-wwan-unlock asap to avoid crunch
[16:02] &lt;sarnold&gt; I believe our current status is happier than this board indicates
[16:02] &lt;eslerm_&gt; please recall that "For a MIR to be considered for a release, it must be assigned to the Security team (by the MIR team) before Beta Freeze"
[16:02] &lt;eslerm_&gt; most of the board is in review :)
[16:04] &lt;slyon&gt; eslerm_: so maybe we should assign libtracefs already. As the pending tests should be independent of security review
[16:04] &lt;slyon&gt; bug #2051925 wdyt?
[16:04] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2051925 in libtracefs (Ubuntu) "[MIR] promote libtracefs as a trace-cmd dependency" [Undecided, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2051925
[16:04] &lt;eslerm_&gt; that was deemed &gt;This does not need a security review
[16:04] &lt;eslerm_&gt; libtracefs*
[16:04] &lt;slyon&gt; oh wait
[16:04] &lt;slyon&gt; right. No need here
[16:05] &lt;slyon&gt; So things are looking good from Foundations POV
[16:05] &lt;sarnold&gt; slyon: would foundatoins want to do a new upload of ndctl to re-pick-up libtracefs?
[16:06] &lt;sarnold&gt; I guess that's not really super-important now, but it's a possibility anyway
[16:06] &lt;slyon&gt; I'd need to check back with the team... But for now I'd say we should first try to get libtracefs in shape
[16:07] &lt;slyon&gt; ndctl is actually owned by server. So they could jump on libtracefs once it got MIR approval
[16:07] &lt;sarnold&gt; ah d'oh
[16:07] &lt;slyon&gt; (essentially dropping the delta)
[16:09] &lt;sarnold&gt; seems like there's not a whole lot more to discuss re: security, and if there is, head to the office hours meeting :)

[16:09] &lt;didrocks&gt; o/ (Iâm back)

[16:09] &lt;slyon&gt; seb128: bug #2015538 might contain some update for you
[16:09] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2015538 in dbus-broker (Ubuntu) "[MIR] dbus-broker" [Undecided, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2015538
[16:09] &lt;didrocks&gt; I did spend half a day already on trying to remove the rust windows dep on authd
[16:09] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes libtrace could be used in other places
[16:09] &lt;didrocks&gt; cargo doesnât cooperate, albeit I am not a Rust expert
[16:09] &lt;slyon&gt; i.e.: we might not need the rust parts for dbus-run-session
[16:10] &lt;didrocks&gt; without guidance, this is really difficult, so I would appreciate any help
[16:10] &lt;sarnold&gt; didrocks: did it just brute-force try to download all those crates during build-time even if they weren't needed for the config in question?
[16:10] &lt;slyon&gt; didrocks: maybe reach out to liushuyu-011
[16:10] &lt;didrocks&gt; sarnold: exactly, and even if you mess up with the .lock files, the checksum doesnât match
[16:10] &lt;sarnold&gt; didrocks: blech.
[16:11] &lt;sarnold&gt; I had really assumed it was just going to ignore everything that it didn't need for that build :(
[16:11] &lt;didrocks&gt; yeah, clearly not :/
[16:12] &lt;didrocks&gt; slyon: I will try, but if he doesnât have any bandwith
[16:12] &lt;sarnold&gt; I really don't like the idea of polluting all our mirrors with hundreds of megabytes of windows-only crates but there's not a whole lot of time left to come up with something to avoid it.
[16:12] &lt;didrocks&gt; not like we do either, we are late to the projects, add more tasks added by day, so I have few hope to get authd in main this cycle
[16:13] &lt;eslerm_&gt; the meaning of *best-effort* is flexible :pray: thank you for your efforts didrocks
[16:13] &lt;didrocks&gt; well, it is what it is, if this is a requirement, fine, just that we will miss the target for this
[16:13] &lt;didrocks&gt; Iâll try again giving another day, and weâll see
[16:13] &lt;sarnold&gt; I think we'd rather be pragmatic
[16:13] &lt;slyon&gt; eslerm_: I agree. If "best-effort" doesn't work out, it needs to be ignored
[16:13] &lt;didrocks&gt; I still think this is more an infrastructure helper tool matter, but I lost that argument already :)
[16:14] &lt;sarnold&gt; no, you're 100% right on that one, too :) it's just that they're in the same boat, heh
[16:14] &lt;didrocks&gt; (same, we have our own tooling for vendoring because itâs not well supported and we start having copy)
[16:14] &lt;didrocks&gt; letâs see how it goes, let me give this another try, but I wanted to update you on the progress (or rather lack of)
[16:14] &lt;sarnold&gt; didrocks: please do shoot liushuyu-011 a quick summary of the goal, where you got stuck, and hope there's a brainstorm :)
[16:14] &lt;didrocks&gt; will try
[16:14] &lt;sarnold&gt; thanks
[16:14] &lt;slyon&gt; thanks!
[16:15] &lt;sarnold&gt; anything else?
[16:15] &lt;slyon&gt; nothing.
[16:15] &lt;didrocks&gt; nothing else either

[16:15] &lt;eslerm_&gt; thanks everyone o/
[16:15] &lt;seb128&gt; slyon, I saw that and need to reply, basically I need to check if the claim that dbus-run-session depends on dbus-daemon make past cycle is true (because if it is then the split isn't going to enough to remove dbus-daemon to universe)
[16:16] &lt;sarnold&gt; thanks cpaelzer, all :)
[16:16] &lt;didrocks&gt; thanks!
[16:16] &lt;didrocks&gt; (for once the meeting is long enough for me to attend the end, Iâll scrollback now)
[16:16] &lt;slyon&gt; thanks all! o/
[16:17] &lt;slyon&gt; seb128: thanks for double-checking this!
[16:18] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thank you all

[10:49] &lt;luna_&gt; amurray: just listened to 222 while updating ubuntu boxes at work guessing 223 is out on Friday as usual?
[11:32] &lt;amurray&gt; luna_: yeah 223 we not be out before friday
[11:45] &lt;luna_&gt; alright then i know thanks :) 
[14:48] &lt;JanC&gt; is it just me or is that bash fix really late?  :-/
[14:56] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; it was rated low priority, but someone convinced us to bump it up
[14:57] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; since, you know, running untrusted bash scripts pretty much already gives you code exec...
[14:57] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; but I guess it's plausible that trusted scripts are handling untrusted data
[14:59] &lt;JanC&gt; I'd say that is a certainty...
[15:03] &lt;JanC&gt; there are entire "applications" written in bash...
[15:06] &lt;JanC&gt; (unfortunately it's hard to find them with apt dependencies as bash is assumed installed...)
[15:07] &lt;JanC&gt; but 'abcde' is an example
[15:11] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; sure, I'd just be curious to see an actual example of a PoC for this that actually does something other than a DoS
[15:12] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; it's a recursive parameter expansion until stack space runs out
[15:13] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; anyway, we did reconsider the priority, and did fix it
[15:14] &lt;JanC&gt; that might be quite difficult to come up with indeed (and maybe also involve bugs in other applications, as bash is often used to glue things together, as e.g. 'abcde' also does)
=== JanC_ is now known as JanC
[15:21] &lt;JanC&gt; oh, and thanks for explaining  :)
[15:25] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; don't spend my 2c all at once :)

[19:02] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 19:02:19 UTC.  The chair is rbasak.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology
[19:02] &lt;meetingology&gt; Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick
[19:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; #topic Package Set/Per Package Uploader Applications
[19:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; #subtopic Miriam EspaÃ±a Acebal
[19:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; mirespace: welcome!
[19:02] &lt;mirespace&gt; rbasak: thank you!
[19:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MiriamEspanaAcebal/ServerUploaderDeveloperApplication
[19:03] &lt;rbasak&gt; mirespace: would you like to introduce yourself please?
[19:03] &lt;mirespace&gt; Hi, my name is Miriam EspaÃ±a Acebal (yes, two surnamesâ¦ Spain is different) and I work as a distro engineer in the CPC team at Canonical.
[19:03] &lt;mirespace&gt; When I joined Canonical in 2021 I started in the Server Team and Iâm still quite involved with them yet.
[19:04] &lt;mirespace&gt; Besides this, I may be mostly known for packaging dotnet (dotnet6 and dotnet7) and introduce it as New in 2022 on Kinetic.
[19:04] &lt;mirespace&gt; Iâm based in Granada (Spain).
[19:04] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thank you! I can start with some questions.
[19:05] &lt;mirespace&gt; ok
[19:05] &lt;rbasak&gt; Where can you find details of the various freeze dates applicable to the current Ubuntu development release cycle? And what freeze applies to the archive at the moment?
[19:05] &lt;mirespace&gt; In the  Noble Schedule: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-schedule/35649
[19:06] &lt;mirespace&gt; We are in Feature Freeze
[19:06] &lt;sil2100&gt; (/me will have a question when rbasak is done with his)
[19:06] &lt;mirespace&gt; and also, you can find that info on IRC, the topic of #ubuntu-devel and #ubuntu-release on Libera Chat is generally updated to indicate the current freeze status.
[19:07] &lt;rbasak&gt; sil2100: ack
[19:08] &lt;rbasak&gt; mirespace: if a package is on version 1.2-3ubuntu1 and you're considering uploading 1.2.1-0ubuntu1, then what information do you need to decide if the upload would be acceptable during feature freeze?
[19:09] &lt;mirespace&gt; the -0 before the ubuntu is telling that we are uploading a version from upstream that us not in Debian, and it would be acceptable if the diff between that versions includes fixes
[19:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; Is there anything that might be present in the diff that would make the upload unacceptable?
[19:11] &lt;mirespace&gt; cosmetic changes that makes the review more difficult and new features described in the changelog or CHANGES file
[19:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; What if the diff contains new features that aren't described in the changelog or CHANGES file?
[19:12] &lt;mirespace&gt; do you mean new features per se, not fixing/ or correcting a anormal behaviour?
[19:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; Yes - so for example imagine that on examining the diff, you notice something that is without doubt a new feature.
[19:14] &lt;mirespace&gt; So, we are talking about a MicroRelease upgrade, and we would need a microrelease exception in place (approved by the release team) to allow it
[19:14] &lt;mirespace&gt; MRE
[19:15] &lt;mirespace&gt; in thios case, the .1 before the -0 points to a microrelease upgrade
[19:15] &lt;mirespace&gt; s/thios/thios/
[19:15] &lt;mirespace&gt; aaah... *this
[19:16] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK thanks. Let's move on. I have more questions, but shall we take turns? sil2100 do you want to go next?
[19:16] &lt;sil2100&gt; o/
[19:16] &lt;mirespace&gt; o?
[19:16] &lt;sil2100&gt; I have 2 small questions
[19:16] &lt;mirespace&gt; o/
[19:16] &lt;mirespace&gt; ok
[19:17] &lt;mirespace&gt; ups (MRE approved by SRU team, sorry)
[19:17] &lt;sil2100&gt; 1) When preparing an SRU, we require filling out the 'template' information in the bug. Part of the template is the Regression Potential / Where problems could occur section. Can you tell me what it is for?
[19:18] &lt;sil2100&gt; What is the purpose of that section?
[19:18] &lt;mirespace&gt; With that part, the uploader demonstrates that the risk of the upload had been deeply considered
[19:19] &lt;seb128&gt; o/ (queuing for a question after Lukasz)
[19:19] &lt;mirespace&gt; Thinking about what else could occurs if my package lands in the archive... not only dfailures of the package itlself
[19:19] &lt;mirespace&gt; also, how it could affect othe packages that usally interacts with it
[19:20] &lt;mirespace&gt; or user/third party scripts that use any part of the package uploaded
[19:20] &lt;sil2100&gt; Okay, second question:
[19:21] &lt;sil2100&gt; 2) When you prepare and upload your SRU, and it gets accepted by the SRU team into -proposed, what are your next responsibilities regarding the SRU? What is expected of you?
[19:22] &lt;mirespace&gt; me (or anyone else) should test the package in -proposed to verify the bug is fixed
[19:22] &lt;mirespace&gt; with the test plan provided by me in the sru template
[19:22] &lt;mirespace&gt; that is used to fill the bug
[19:22] &lt;mirespace&gt; if the package, later, it's released because the aging period is reached
[19:23] &lt;mirespace&gt; I should take a look to the component mistmached page to see if the package builds OK or have a regression (itself or with other packages)
[19:24] &lt;mirespace&gt; I mean, taking care it passes the tests (DEP8) for the archs it builds
[19:24] &lt;mirespace&gt; the comp0onent mismatche no, the update excuses, sorry
[19:24] &lt;sil2100&gt; You mentioned component mismatches?
[19:24] &lt;sil2100&gt; Ah, yes
[19:24] &lt;sil2100&gt; This is what I wanted to see!
[19:24] &lt;mirespace&gt; https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html
[19:24] &lt;mirespace&gt; (too much MIR work lately, sorry)
[19:25] &lt;mirespace&gt; :)
[19:25] &lt;sil2100&gt; mirespace: this is the update_excuses page for the development series. If, say, you had an upload in jammy, where would you look for autopkgtest results?
[19:25] &lt;mirespace&gt; https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/jammy/update_excuses.html
[19:26] &lt;mirespace&gt; the scheme would be :  https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/&lt;supported_series&gt;/update_excuses.html
[19:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Ok, thanks! That's enough from me
[19:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; seb128, rbasak: ^
[19:27] &lt;rbasak&gt; seb128: over to you
[19:27] &lt;seb128&gt; mirespace, you mentioned a MRE earlier ... what is a MRE for you and where/to which serie does that apply?
[19:28] &lt;mirespace&gt; we want to provide to users of our supported series (LTS or interim at the moment of the MRE) with the more stable experience when using a piece of software
[19:29] &lt;mirespace&gt; to provide this, sometimes is needed to upgrade versions of packages in stable releases that include not only security fixes : new features too, in the sense
[19:30] &lt;mirespace&gt; of replacing supporting of a feature/protocol/package  that is going to dissapear
[19:30] &lt;mirespace&gt; or to maintain the package usable in a supported series
[19:31] &lt;mirespace&gt; It's used mostly for packages that impact the series/are very used in the community
[19:31] &lt;mirespace&gt; i.e., dpdk
[19:31] &lt;seb128&gt; mirespace, so for a such case what would be the process? would you need to ask for the exception (and if so how/to who)? or is there any guideline describing those exception cases?
[19:32] &lt;mirespace&gt; You need to follow https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#New_upstream_microreleases
[19:33] &lt;mirespace&gt; Writting the MRE exception to be included into the https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates, once approved by the SRU team
[19:33] &lt;seb128&gt; mirespace, ok, thanks for your replies, that's enough for me :)
[19:34] &lt;mirespace&gt; in that exception you need to expose the reasons about why we should do it, what extra test we are doing
[19:34] &lt;mirespace&gt; and special considerations to take care (release cadence, for example)
[19:34] &lt;mirespace&gt; ok ... sorry for continuing answering :$
[19:34] &lt;seb128&gt; no worry, please keep writting if you have more to say
[19:35] &lt;mirespace&gt; it's ok :)
[19:35] &lt;seb128&gt; it's sometime difficult in written to know when the other side is done write
[19:35] &lt;seb128&gt; just finish with some sort of &lt;/end&gt; :)
[19:35] &lt;mirespace&gt; I agree totally wit you on that
[19:35] &lt;mirespace&gt; good idea
[19:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK I guess that line of questions is done? I was going to ask about proposed migration in the development release, but you've already basically answered my question above.
[19:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; So I have no further questions.
[19:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; Anyone else?
[19:36] &lt;seb128&gt; no further question from me

[19:40] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from bdmurray
[19:40] &lt;rbasak&gt; kanashiro: vote?
[19:40]  * bdmurray needs to run though
[19:42] &lt;seb128&gt; mirespace, the policy section you referred to is about microreleases including bugfixing, it doesn't cover features. Also usually a MRE is a special rule you ask for a special projects (like you mentioned for services); it wouldn't be the solution to a new feature being added to a microrelease of a random package
[19:43] &lt;seb128&gt; mirespace, also I got slightly confused that the MRE mention came in a discussion about feature freeze, which means devel release and not a stable one, so the process would be a FFe
[19:44] &lt;mirespace&gt; yes, you're right... i had in my notes new upstream (microrelease)
[19:44] &lt;mirespace&gt; for FFe

[19:48] &lt;seb128&gt; there is a kubuntu set update request that teward might be handling or not? (I'm unsure from his message)
[19:48] &lt;rbasak&gt; I remember seeing his reply, but I don't see it in my list archives
[19:48] &lt;rbasak&gt; Any idea where it is?
[19:48] &lt;bdmurray&gt; In two weeks people will have expired from the team
[19:49] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, it's on the dev-membership one
[19:49] &lt;seb128&gt; bdmurray, yes, I was going to mention that once we are in AOB :)
[19:49] &lt;rbasak&gt; seb128: thanks. It should be on the public list really :-/
[19:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; seb128: given you replied today, shall we treat it as making progress, and follow up next time?
[19:50] &lt;seb128&gt; +1
[19:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; I don't see anything else unaddressed on the ML.
[19:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; #topic Open TB bugs
[19:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; #info No open TB bugs
[19:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; #topic AOB
[19:51] &lt;seb128&gt; what bdmurray said ^
[19:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thank you for noting the schedule.
[19:51] &lt;seb128&gt; kanashiro, bdmurray and me will have our membership expired by the next meeting
[19:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; I guess in Utkarsh's absence perhaps we should assume that the answer is that no, he doesn't have the capacity, and so we should find someone else to run it?
[19:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; ...and the other seats expire on 16 June
[19:53] &lt;seb128&gt; I think it would be nice but any idea who the someone could be?
[19:53] &lt;rbasak&gt; I have done it in the past and am happy to volunteer to do it again
[19:53] &lt;seb128&gt; also I don't remember how we ended up there but it's unfortunate those expirations are back to back
[19:53] &lt;rbasak&gt; I would like to combine the two sets though, rather than run two elections two months apart.
[19:53] &lt;seb128&gt; +1 from me
[19:54] &lt;seb128&gt; to be clear +1 for you to handle it but also for combining
[19:54] &lt;rbasak&gt; Since the results are ranked, we can agree that the top three ranking candidates will take their seats immediately, and the other four will take their seats in June.
[19:54] &lt;sil2100&gt; Same here
[19:54]  * sil2100 needs to drop, sadly o/
[19:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; unfortunate hose expirations are back to back&gt; should we try to re-stagger them?
[19:55] &lt;seb128&gt; unsure how we do that, it's also late in the slot to have that discussion now?
[19:56] &lt;rbasak&gt; For example, normally the term is two years. We could make the second set one year only, so then we'll have two halves (modulo integer division) staggered one year apart again.
[19:56] &lt;seb128&gt; I would say just go with the election and the new board can put that on their agenda
[19:59] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let me write to the list with a detailed proposal, since there are some other bits I can think of that I need agreement for in order that the combined election will work.
[19:59] &lt;rbasak&gt; Anything else to discuss?
[20:00] &lt;seb128&gt; not from me
[20:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; #endmeeting
[20:00] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 20:00:06 UTC.  Minutes at https://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting/2024/ubuntu-meeting.2024-03-18-19.02.moin.txt
[20:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks all!
[20:00] &lt;mirespace&gt; than you all seb128 rbasak bdmurray sil2100 !
[20:00] &lt;seb128&gt; thanks rbasak
[20:00] &lt;mirespace&gt; How bad are the nervesssssss
[20:02] &lt;seb128&gt; and thanks DMB members it was fun being part of the board (unsure if I'm going to re-apply yet, I'm struggling to find the needed time often)
[20:03] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, I guess next meeting is only with 4 members but it's still enough to get a quorum on votes if needed
[20:03] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, unless we have a list vote on your proposal before us 3 expire
[20:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; seb128: a list vote is fine, but also when this has happened in the past the TB has always been willing to temporarily extend the existing terms to cover the gap.
[20:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; I've emailed the list with my proposal.
[20:19] &lt;seb128&gt; thanks
[20:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; I hope it is unambiguous and covers the edge cases. Please scrutinize!
[21:32] &lt;teward&gt; i apologize i was not present rbasak and all. unexpected call into the office today for the whole day

[16:55] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; good grief, C is so full of footguns. Alright, that's what I had to say, thank you.
[16:56] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (Trying to patch GRUB, and graduated from shell patches to actual bootloader patches. Trying to figure out if my strcpy is going to work without causing a buffer overflow is breaking my brain.
[16:57] &lt;sdeziel&gt; apparently, that didn't stop them from adding image decoding to GRUB ;)
[16:59] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; If I survive this without accidentally creating at least one security vulnerability, I'm going to be relieved and slightly surprised.
[16:59] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I just hope someone reviews my code really carefully :P
[16:59] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; we can pre-emptively assign you some CVEs now if you want :)
[16:59] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; hahahahaha
[17:00] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; thankfully "all" I have to do is introduce two environment variable lookups and fallbacks, that's it. As long as I can juggle the semantics of `len`, `strcpy`, and `sizeof` without dropping anything, we're good.
[17:01] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (you can probably tell I almost never write C code)
[17:01] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; all 3? without messing up?
[17:04] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; actually my job may be done, looks like GRUB wisely reuses the open_envblk_file code for both loading and saving the environment block.
[17:07] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; anyway, if someone does want to see if I've successfully dodged all bullets, this was my patch: https://termbin.com/467u And this is the file after patching: https://termbin.com/cnix Goal - make `load_env` and `save_env` look at the `envpath` environment variable, and open the environment block from that file if the variable is set. Otherwise, fall back to using `prefix` like before.
[17:14] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; arraybolt3: I'd send your diff to chrisc to review, he's used to looking at grub code

[15:05] &lt;enr0n&gt; bdmurray: yes, I requested seb on the MP
[15:06] &lt;upils&gt; o/
[15:07] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I'd like to see a photo of "bug grooming"
[15:08] &lt;vorlon&gt; adrien: what specifically does openssl need to support wrt LTO?
[15:09] &lt;upils&gt; bdmurray, would "backlog grooming" be more appropriate?
[15:10] &lt;bdmurray&gt; IDK I just thought it'd be funny to groom a flea  / ant.
[15:10] &lt;vorlon&gt; do you have nits
[15:11] &lt;adrien&gt; \o
[15:11] &lt;adrien&gt; oh, DST, that's why, and I'll be not so available :/
[15:11] &lt;adrien&gt; but let me find that
[15:11] &lt;schopin&gt; vorlon: I think adrien meant something related to https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/18663
[15:11] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Issue 18663 in openssl/openssl "-Werror=free-nonheap-object warnings with GCC LTO" [Open]
[15:12] &lt;adrien&gt; there are several issues, and at least a recent one with clang and ppc64el
[15:12] &lt;adrien&gt; it all revolves around aliasing
[15:12] &lt;adrien&gt; moreover I'm not sure it brings much performance for openssl
[15:12] &lt;schopin&gt; And it surely murder the build time :)
[15:13] &lt;ginggs&gt; bdrung: do you plan to sync libapache2-mod-python ?
[15:13] &lt;juliank&gt; let's move on
[15:13] &lt;juliank&gt; #topic Release incoming bugs
[15:13] &lt;bdmurray&gt; vorlon: Do you have experience w/ umockdev and the fake devices script in ubuntu-drivers-common?
[15:13] &lt;vorlon&gt; schopin: "glibc now treating C.UTF-8 the same way it does C" hmm in what way?  I did have a build failure I was debugging recently that was locale-sensitive
[15:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; (though I've forgotten which)
[15:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; bdmurray: sorry, I don't
[15:14] &lt;bdrung&gt; ginggs, yes. thanks for the reminder
[15:14] &lt;juliank&gt; #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-nn-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs
[15:14] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2054716
[15:14] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2054716 in systemd (Ubuntu) "package polkitd 124-1 failed to install/upgrade: installed polkitd package post-installation script subprocess returned error exit status 1" [High, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2054716
[15:14] &lt;schopin&gt; vorlon: AIUI it won't even look up translations if the locale is C
[15:14] &lt;bdmurray&gt; that's well in hand
[15:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; schopin: ah - that actually sounds related to the bug I saw
[15:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; good to know
=== rkratky__ is now known as rkratky
[15:15] &lt;juliank&gt; enr0n: Should we just untag the bug or do you want it in jira?
[15:16] &lt;enr0n&gt; juliank: let's just untag it
[15:16] &lt;juliank&gt; ack
[15:16] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2056562
[15:16] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2056562 in shim-signed (Ubuntu) "shim-signed 1.57+15.8-0ubuntu1 upgrade failing due to grub-common/2.12-1ubuntu3 still being present during installation" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2056562
[15:17] &lt;juliank&gt; I think we can actually just respin noble's shim-signed with Breaks: grub-common (= 2.12-1ubuntu3) for the few people affected by this
[15:17] &lt;juliank&gt; It's an ... unconventional use of Breaks, but it avoids order entanglement at upgrade
[15:19] &lt;juliank&gt; and that's it for incoming bugs nothing to see in other releases
[15:19] &lt;juliank&gt; #topic Team proposed-migration report
[15:19] &lt;juliank&gt; #link https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs
[15:19] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon:
[15:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; does the page load today? let's see
[15:20] &lt;juliank&gt; I find the issue with my proposed-migration is the runners are full so I don't have the results from last weeks items yet
[15:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; 450 packages needing attention
[15:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; libselinux was mentioned in somebody's status report I think?
[15:21] &lt;schopin&gt; adrien but he's AFK right now because DST
[15:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok
[15:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; so I'll leave libselinux with adrien
[15:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; waveform: you're still working on python-ldap?
[15:22] &lt;waveform&gt; yup
[15:22] &lt;vorlon&gt; is hyask not here?
[15:22] &lt;vorlon&gt; ah Skia
[15:22] &lt;schopin&gt; Skia: ^
[15:22] &lt;vorlon&gt; Skia: you're ok to follow through on libbsd vs gvmd?
[15:23] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-apt vs apt: juliank
[15:23] &lt;juliank&gt; I'm doing all the apt ones
[15:23] &lt;vorlon&gt; ack
[15:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; a lot of armhf autopkgtest failures there that need retried with --all-proposed, for sure
[15:24] &lt;Skia&gt; vorlon: yes, it's just been a moving target all the week, but I do plan on continuing to follow this
[15:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; mkukri: are you still on dnspython vs samba?
[15:24] &lt;juliank&gt; I'm kind trying to build the recursive list of dependencies and add them as triggers to avoid even more failures from all-proposed
[15:25] &lt;mkukri&gt; ack
[15:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; I had curl vs nettle assigned last week; this week it looks like curl vs libpsl.  anyway this is all tied into the time_t transition, and I'll follow up
[15:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; and on libpsl generally
[15:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: does 'all the apt ones' include apt blocking xz-utils on armhf?
[15:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; libtirpc: still with liushuyu ?
[15:27] &lt;juliank&gt; well, everything blocking apt 2.7.12-&gt;2.17.3ubuntu1
[15:27] &lt;upils&gt; that seems related yes. I am waiting for a restest to confirm
[15:27] &lt;upils&gt; *retest
[15:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; upils: sorry, which is that in response to?
[15:27] &lt;juliank&gt; apt blocking xz-utils is what upils retried earlier
[15:27] &lt;upils&gt; yes
[15:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; ah yes
[15:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok
[15:28] &lt;juliank&gt; Any apt/2.7.12 result needs retrying with apt/2.7.13 trigger
[15:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; bear in mind that for any autopkgtest failures on armhf specifically, they should be retested with --all-proposed because 99% are going to require this due to time_t
[15:28] &lt;juliank&gt; because apt builds test helpers at test time with now t64 that fail to link against the old t32 library from 2.7.12
[15:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; and if that still fails you should check that the package has been rebuilt in -proposed for the new library package name, and if not, arrange no-change rebuilds
[15:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; libuv1 is still with mwhudson
[15:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; freetype didn't get assigned last week - bdrung can you take it?
[15:29] &lt;bdrung&gt; ack
[15:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; optipng - bdmurray ?
[15:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; libgd2 - cpete__ ?
[15:30] &lt;cpete__&gt; bdmurack
[15:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; is cpete an internal gcc macro
[15:30] &lt;cpete__&gt; ack
[15:30] &lt;bdmurray&gt; okay
[15:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; casper vs plymouth: dbungert
[15:30] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Tim would like one too
[15:31] &lt;dbungert&gt; ack for casper vs plymouth
[15:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; slang2: Tim
[15:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; nfs-utils vs adsys: danilogondolfo
[15:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; pyopenssl: ginggs
[15:31] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; vorlon, ack
[15:31] &lt;ginggs&gt; ack
=== cpete__ is now known as cpete
[15:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; software-properties vs dconf: ooh it's not a time_t one.  xypron
[15:32] &lt;xypron&gt; ok
[15:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; xypron: actually there are 3 separate autopkgtest failures on arm64 in response to dconf: software-properties, update-manager, update-notifier.  So probably a dconf regression, can you look at all of these please?
[15:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; (dconf itself is not ours, so it's ok if the investigation results in turning it over to the Desktop Team to fix)
[15:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; libvpx: slyon
[15:33] &lt;slyon&gt; ok
[15:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; initramfs-tools vs netplan.io on armhf: mateus-morais
[15:34] &lt;mateus-morais&gt; ack
[15:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; libgtk3-perl: enr0n
[15:34] &lt;enr0n&gt; vorlon: ack
[15:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; software-properties vs gtk+3.0: ogayot
[15:34] &lt;bdrung&gt; vorlon, I am taking initramfs-tools vs netplan.io - this needs just some handholding
[15:34] &lt;ogayot&gt; vorlon: ack
[15:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; ubuntu-release-upgrader vs gtk+2.0: mateus-morais since bdrung is stealing
[15:35] &lt;mateus-morais&gt; vorlon: ok
[15:35] &lt;bdrung&gt; (i want to check that the initramfs-tools tests became stable again)
[15:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; mateus-morais: please also take update-manager, update-notifier, and vim blocking gtk+3.0 - these are probably all just autopkgtest retries
[15:35] &lt;mateus-morais&gt; ack
[15:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; fwupd vs libmbim: pushkarnk
[15:36] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; ack
[15:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; pushkarnk: fwupd is also blocking libqmi and modemmanager, so please check on these too, probably same root cause
[15:36] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; vorlon: ok
[15:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; pango1.0 vs harfbuzz: schopin
[15:36] &lt;schopin&gt; ack
[15:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; schopin: hmmm raqm and pango1.0 both fail on harfbuzz/arm64, please look at both
[15:37] &lt;schopin&gt; ok
[15:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; cryptsetup vs jq: zhsj
[15:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; and we'll stop there
[15:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; anyone who runs out of things to do this week on proposed-migration, there's plenty more ;)
[15:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: back to you
[15:37] &lt;zhsj&gt; ack

[15:40] &lt;juliank&gt; any other business?
[15:40] &lt;juliank&gt; any other busyness? :D
[15:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; busy busy
[15:41] &lt;juliank&gt; I still need to take half a day this month!
[15:41] &lt;schopin&gt; 29th afternoon?
[15:41] &lt;juliank&gt; Probably like next Wednesday afternoon?
[15:41] &lt;bdrung&gt; I am taking my remaining days at the end of the month
[15:41] &lt;juliank&gt; Rather ad-hoc when it's sunny and nobody wants to meet
[15:42] &lt;enr0n&gt; I will be out most of next week. Starting Tuesday afternoon, and will be back the following Monday
[15:43] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I'll be working in a different location most of next week
[15:44] &lt;schopin&gt; bdmurray: will your working hours change?
[15:44] &lt;bdmurray&gt; No
[15:44] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Same time zone

[16:19] &lt;jccgjw&gt; test
[16:22] &lt;ebarretto&gt; worked 
[16:33] &lt;ahasenack&gt; hi #security, apparmor question
[16:34] &lt;ahasenack&gt; I *think* that after I enabled these systemd isolation features in a service (https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/zdbwSXbSMQ/), I started getting the apparmor "failed name lookup - disconnected path" errors
[16:34] &lt;ahasenack&gt; I'm about to try removing some of those changes, but this test takes a long time to run, like 2h
[16:34] &lt;ahasenack&gt; and I wanted to get some input here before
[16:34] &lt;ahasenack&gt; maybe you can spot that it is true, and point me at which one of the changes in the systemd service file could trigger this error?
[16:35] &lt;ahasenack&gt; I'm thinking PrivateTmp, just because it's the only thing file-system related, but I don't really know
[16:35] &lt;ahasenack&gt; this was run inside a lxd container
[16:36] &lt;ahasenack&gt; this is also a weird one, name="apparmor/.null":
[16:36] &lt;ahasenack&gt; pparmor="DENIED" operation="getattr" class="file" info="Failed name lookup - disconnected path" error=-13 namespace="root//lxd-upro-behave-bionic-system-under-test-0311-181926277595_&lt;var-snap-lxd-common-lxd&gt;" profile="ubuntu_pro_esm_cache" name="apparmor/.null" pid=7519 comm="python3" requested_mask="r" denied_mask="r" fsuid=1000000 ouid=0
[16:36] &lt;ebarretto&gt; georgiag ^ 
[16:39] &lt;sdeziel&gt; ahasenack: `PrivateTmp=` causes mount name spaces to be used which is what leads to those disconnected path errors, afaik
[16:40] &lt;ahasenack&gt; so it's a tradeoff: if using privatetmp, I have to use flags=(attach_disconnected) in the profile
[19:06] &lt;sarnold&gt; ahasenack: and the apparmor/.null bit is apparmor replacing the filedescriptor for the denied file with a new one, so that the process doesn't run with *no* filedescriptor where it expected one
[19:07] &lt;sarnold&gt; ahasenack: (a decade or two ago it was popular to run setuid programs without stdin or stdout or whatever and then hilarity ensues when they open() something for writing, and unrelated status output also goes to that file..)
=== jccgjw1 is now known as jccgjw
[20:19] &lt;ahasenack&gt; sarnold: do you know if "flags=(attach_disconnected)" is propagated to child profiles?
[20:20] &lt;sarnold&gt; ahasenack: I don't know but I would guess it isn't
[20:20] &lt;ahasenack&gt; I'm thinking it's not, based on what I just saw in the logs of my test...
[20:20] &lt;ahasenack&gt; because I added the flag to the parent profile, and now the logs have the same error but all in child profiles
[20:20] &lt;sarnold&gt; heh that's what that sounds like

[15:31] &lt;sarnold&gt; good morning
[15:32] &lt;slyon&gt; for c-m: We got trace-cmd seeded while the MIR is not yet fully ready. But It's beeing worked on. I linked the most recent MIRs for libtraceevent and libtracefs this morning
[15:32] &lt;slyon&gt; libtraceevent is making some progress (patch adding tests needs review &amp; sponsoring), libtracefs is stuck currently reaching out for help from the Foundations system squad
[15:33] &lt;slyon&gt; c-m-proposed: we have a bunch of new stuff in here..
[15:33] &lt;slyon&gt; gst-plugins-good1.0 and roc-toolkit are desktop-packages. So I'd like to ask didrocks to investigate those (later on)
[15:34] &lt;slyon&gt; jaraco.text and python-openstacksdk are ubuntu-openstack packages, for jamespage to look into.

[15:35] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2056099 in tree (Ubuntu) "[MIR] tree" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2056099
[15:35] &lt;slyon&gt; was this discussed last week? (I wasn't here)
[15:36] &lt;slyon&gt; looks like foundations agreed to own the package. So it could go through MIR review.
[15:36] &lt;sarnold&gt; I think last week we decided to see if foundations would accept it
[15:36] &lt;ahresse_&gt; Hello, this has been discussed last year and a owner was missing but foundation is actually willing to take it.
[15:36] &lt;sarnold&gt; and the last comment suggests that they have :)
[15:36] &lt;ahresse_&gt; last week*
[15:36] &lt;slyon&gt; do we have any volunteers? (I'd like to abstain, as this will be foundations owned)
[15:36] &lt;slyon&gt; joalif or cpaelzer maybe?
[15:37] &lt;joalif&gt; slyon: I can take it
[15:37] &lt;slyon&gt; thank you!

[15:39] &lt;slyon&gt; there are two *trace* updates (bug #2051916 &amp; bug #2051925) that I explained earlier. Nothing actionable for the MIR team, yet.

[15:39]  * slyon reading...
[15:40] &lt;slyon&gt; MIR reviewer asked for additional/improved testing. Upstream developers are involved. So this is correctly set to "Incomplete" and back to the reporter for now until resolved.
[15:40] &lt;slyon&gt; Nothing to do for us

[15:43] &lt;slyon&gt; let's put our +1 or suggestions for improvement on GitHub, so paelzer can mere once ready
[15:43] &lt;slyon&gt; merge*
[15:44] &lt;slyon&gt; Then we have eslerm's https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/51
[15:44] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Issue 51 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "cargo vendor adds unnecessary crates" [Open]
[15:45] &lt;slyon&gt; consensus seems to be adding per-package hacks in debian/rules to delete unnecessary vendored crates. Which was my understanding, too.
[15:46] &lt;slyon&gt; This is not nice, but probably better than shipping (and reviewing) lots of unused code.
[15:46] &lt;slyon&gt; I brought the cause up with the Foundations toolchaing squad. They are currently busy, so we should not expect a centralized solution soon. I'll try to push it for next cycle's roadmap, though.
[15:47] &lt;slyon&gt; so I guess that it's mostly for didrocks to look into fixing/cleaning up his package manually
[15:47] &lt;slyon&gt; #topic MIR related Security Review Queue

[15:49] &lt;slyon&gt; bug #2055434 looks like it needs a `sec-*` tag
[15:49] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2055434 in pemmican (Ubuntu) "[MIR] pemmican" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2055434
[15:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; slyon: I belivee that we're still doing alright, but some departures from the team may impact our velocity if we have late additions in the cycle
[15:50] &lt;slyon&gt; The number of new MIRs has been relatively low (or rather balanced before feature freeze) this cycle. Let's hope it stays this way and we don't get a lot of late additions.
[15:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; there we go, https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/SEC-3971
[15:50] &lt;slyon&gt; sweet thanks!
[15:51] &lt;slyon&gt; #topic Any other business?
[15:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; yeah, it's felt very calm .. a little too calm .. *harmonica music*
[15:51] &lt;joalif&gt; sarnold: wrt https://warthogs.atlassian.net/browse/SEC-3971 it may not need a sec review after all
[15:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; none here (well, I've got a very small nagging feeling that I've forgotten something. sigh. but if I can't remember it now...)
[15:53] &lt;slyon&gt; joalif: that's because it's not a root daemon?
[15:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; joalif: it sounded a bit like it's got a root daemon and a client of some sort, but I couldn't quickly tell if non-root was supposed to be able to use it, etc ..
[15:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; if non-root processes are communicating with a root daemon as part of the task, then it's probably worth a quick look
[15:54] &lt;joalif&gt; well it's not a deamon, and th i spent quite some time if this needs a sec review and decided to play on safe side and put it for sec review
[15:55] &lt;joalif&gt; ok lemme discuss it with waveform  on the bug and if need be i'll remove it from sec review
[15:55] &lt;slyon&gt; thanks joalif!
[15:55] &lt;sarnold&gt; nice, thanks :)
[15:56] &lt;slyon&gt; If nothing else, that's all for today.
[15:56] &lt;joalif&gt; nothing else from me

[20:05] &lt;amurray&gt; will carry-over since we will try again once rbasak is feeling better

[20:06] &lt;seb128&gt; carry over please
[20:07] &lt;amurray&gt; I wanted to ask a quick question on this - I have the process ready for the security team but just wasn't sure where to post it? any ideas? discourse / wiki?
[20:07] &lt;seb128&gt; either is fine I think
[20:08] &lt;seb128&gt; people seem to prefer discourse nowadays
[20:08] &lt;amurray&gt; ok - will go with that then - thanks

[20:09] &lt;vorlon&gt; sorry, haven't gotten to this yet
[20:10] &lt;vorlon&gt; I guess if we're voting yes on Kubuntu now it's not urgent?
[20:10] &lt;vorlon&gt; but I would still like to keep the action, to do before 24.04, unless someone else wants to learn about this stuff from me and work on it
[20:10] &lt;amurray&gt; not urgent but I would still like to see them finalise their list before the LTS goes out
[20:10] &lt;vorlon&gt; indeed
[20:11] &lt;amurray&gt; hmm also should there be an action item on me for the kubuntu LTS request?
[20:11] &lt;amurray&gt; I don
[20:11] &lt;amurray&gt; 't see anything - will add one

[20:14] &lt;seb128&gt; ack
[20:14] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic AOB
[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; one item for AOB
[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; I noticed when doing a "census" from the Release Team side of our LTS qualifications
[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; that Ubuntu MATE doesn't appear to have applied yet for LTS status
[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; does someone want to reach out to them and find out if they plan to?
[20:14] &lt;seb128&gt; right, that was discussed yesterday during the flavors sync call
[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; (it's fine if they don't do LTS, of course)
[20:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: oh ok - what's the news?
[20:15] &lt;seb128&gt; someone took an action item to reach to Martin to ask
[20:15] &lt;seb128&gt; but the few people who had feedback said that the MATE team seems mostly inactive recently
[20:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok
[20:16] &lt;seb128&gt; ah, someone was Mauro
[20:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; that's fine then
[20:16] &lt;seb128&gt; (just checked the meeting note)
[20:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; I just didn't want this to slip by unnoticed
[20:16] &lt;amurray&gt; there is a topic over in their discourse but I don't see anything definitive there
[20:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; since the MATE team's communications preferences seem misaligned with the Release Team's and the Tech Board's these days
[20:16] &lt;amurray&gt; #link https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/plans-for-24-04-lts/27110/4
[20:17] &lt;seb128&gt; amurray, right, I think that one was used as a basis for the claim that the dev team isn't responsive/around much recently
[20:19] &lt;amurray&gt; I'll ask in that thread as well and tag Martin as well
[20:19] &lt;seb128&gt; amurray, thanks (and maybe check first with Mauro if he already did since he took an action about it yesterday)
[20:19] &lt;seb128&gt; well I mean reaching out to them
[20:20] &lt;seb128&gt; though I guess a public post wouldn't hurt in any case
[20:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; Martin *did* come to the Ubuntu Summit so it's not entirely moribund?
[20:20] &lt;amurray&gt; yeah I think its fine for the TB to enquire for our own purposes - it would definitely be a shame for MATE to not be part of the LTS
[20:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; again, it's fine if a flavor doesn't want to do LTS support
[20:21] &lt;seb128&gt; right, well let's see what they reply
[20:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; just don't want to make sure that's a conscious decision (or the outcome of an assessment of the flavor's capacity), not an accident of timing
[20:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; s/don't//
[20:21] &lt;amurray&gt; agreed
[20:21] &lt;amurray&gt; thanks for raising it vorlon
[20:22] &lt;amurray&gt; anything else?
[20:22] &lt;vorlon&gt; nothing else here
[20:22] &lt;seb128&gt; nothing from me
[20:22] &lt;amurray&gt; easy - thanks folks

[12:54] &lt;youngbin&gt; So, let's have a look at agenda first
[12:54] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Hello youngbin
[12:54] &lt;youngbin&gt; Agenda: Follow up on action items from last meeting / Fix agenda / AOB / Next meeting schedule and chair
[12:55] &lt;youngbin&gt; if we don't more topics to discuss, let start with follow up on action items from last meeting
[12:55] &lt;youngbin&gt; #topic Follow up on action items from last meeting
[12:55] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Sorry was occupied with Ubucon asia stuff so wasn't active on Matrix channel
[12:55] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; So need to followup which I will do tomorrow
[12:56] &lt;youngbin&gt; Ah no worries im also busy with organizing bunch of events lol
[12:56] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Haha okay ð
[12:56] &lt;youngbin&gt; So i think we don't have organized note for last meeting. if it's ok let me follow up based on this one... https://gemini.google.com/share/25540f1b2216
[12:56] &lt;youngbin&gt; 1. Follow up with Mauro about setting up the LoCo Council matrix room.
[12:57] &lt;youngbin&gt; We now have Matrix space and room for LoCos
[12:58] &lt;youngbin&gt; #info We now have Matrix space and room for LoCos
[12:58] &lt;youngbin&gt; 2. Create a topic on Discourse to discuss proposals for regular LoCo activity reporting. - any idea what was this about?
[12:59] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; It was related to get a note of loco activities I guess
[12:59] &lt;youngbin&gt; ah to follow up on loco activity update?
[13:00] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes and a follow up thing to this was to create a survey
[13:01] &lt;youngbin&gt; #info Create a topic on Discourse to follow up on LoCo activity updates. - Follow up thing was to crate a survey
[13:02] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; And come up with questions for the survey but on a personal level got very busy with the venue and contracts for Ubucon asia..
[13:02] &lt;youngbin&gt; yes i remember discussion on matrix. i guess not much progress since then
[13:02] &lt;youngbin&gt; 3. Each council member to come up with questions for the LoCo health survey.
[13:02] &lt;youngbin&gt; this should be the survey we just mentioned...
[13:02] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; (time to get things moving I guess now regarding Ubucon Asia :))
[13:03] &lt;youngbin&gt; 4. Reach out to LoCo leaders to participate in the AMA.
[13:03] &lt;youngbin&gt; i think for me, i got no updates
[13:04] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Me too so lets work on the previous action items and come up with things on the next meeting perhaps ð
[13:04] &lt;youngbin&gt; #info Reach out to LoCo leaders to participate in the AMA. - No updates from meeting participants for now
[13:05] &lt;youngbin&gt; So let's move on to next topic
[13:05] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes
[13:05] &lt;youngbin&gt; #topic Fixed agenda
[13:05] &lt;youngbin&gt; I would like to suggest have some fixed agenda.
[13:06] &lt;youngbin&gt; For example: Action item follow up, AOB(Any other business), Next meeting schedule and chair
[13:06] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1
[13:06] &lt;youngbin&gt; other then this 3 items are there other fixed agneda that we should have?
[13:07] &lt;youngbin&gt; agneda -&gt; agenda
[13:07] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; None I can think of right now
[13:07] &lt;youngbin&gt; ok then i think we can vote on 3 fixed agenda. btw...
[13:08] &lt;youngbin&gt; kanashiro: are you present?
[13:09] &lt;youngbin&gt; ok let me setup vote just a minute...

[13:12] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Orelse we will not have quorum
[13:17] &lt;youngbin&gt; let's wait a bit more for 3 min then pass. maybe we can discuss again on next meeting?
[13:18] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Sure
[13:19] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Since there is no quorum now we can shift the agenda to our next meeting I guess
[13:19] &lt;youngbin&gt; yups

[13:23] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; You can chair
[13:24] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; As this meeting had no quorum

[16:14] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2056375
[16:14] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2056375 in mokutil (Ubuntu) "Ubuntu Studio ISO fails to build: '/usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: failed to get canonical path of `overlay'.'" [Critical, Fix Committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2056375
[16:15] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon: you tagged this but it's basically waiting for mokutil to migrate which has a dep-wait on armhf, where we don't even use mokutil and forced grub through
[16:15] &lt;juliank&gt; or rather force deleted grub
[16:15] &lt;juliank&gt; should we just force delete mokutil in armhf?
[16:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: I don't follow how it's a mokutil issue, how would that force the removal of packages?
[16:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; I can certainly force delete mokutil on armhf, I don't mind
[16:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; I just don't follow how you figured that out
[16:17] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon: grub is removed because it is built against libefivar1t64, and we install mokutil from release pocket which still uses libefivar1
[16:17] &lt;juliank&gt; migrating new mokutil with libefivar1t64 depends fixes issue
[16:17] &lt;vorlon&gt; except the libefivar1 dep should be satisfied by libefivar1t64 Provides: libefivar1
[16:18] &lt;vorlon&gt; if promoting mokutil works around it, that's fine, let's just do that
[16:18] &lt;vorlon&gt; and we can move on to the next bug here :)
[16:18] &lt;juliank&gt; APT being stupid I suppose
[16:18] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2055720
[16:18] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2055720 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "Edubuntu upgrade removed universe repo mantic -&gt; noble" [High, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2055720
[16:19] &lt;enr0n&gt; The main reason I tagged this is that when u-r-u doesn't find valid sources, it offers to setup default sources. Currently that means configuring main and restricted. That's just wrong, right?
[16:19] &lt;enr0n&gt; At the very least it's inconsistent with the default sources described in https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/spec-apt-deb822-sources-by-default/29333
[16:19] &lt;juliank&gt; Indeed
[16:20] &lt;schopin&gt; Do we enable universe by default?
[16:20] &lt;schopin&gt; On a new install, I mean.
[16:20] &lt;waveform&gt; we used to
[16:21] &lt;waveform&gt; there was an issue where they were disabled ... I think that came up in mantic with ubuntu-image produced builds but it was fixed before release I believe
[16:21] &lt;enr0n&gt; ogayot and dbungert would probably know what we do on default installs
[16:21]  * Eickmeyer chimes
[16:22] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; Flavors require universe on new installs
[16:22] &lt;waveform&gt; yes, LP: #2037018
[16:22]  * Eickmeyer chimes out
[16:22] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2037018 in ubuntu "universe and multiverse missing from apt sources" [Undecided, Fix Released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2037018
[16:23] &lt;vorlon&gt; enr0n: "default" sources should include universe, for all install types
[16:23] &lt;enr0n&gt; vorlon: cool thanks
[16:23] &lt;upils&gt; ubuntu-image is setting main,restricted by default but some (ex. ubuntu-server-pi-arm64) configurations do override it to add universe and multiverse
[16:23] &lt;vorlon&gt; I think multiverse should also be enabled though the history there is a bit muddled
[16:23]  * juliank relatedly is also working with josch to get a hook added to mmdebstrap that auomtatically enables universe on Ubuntu systems
[16:23] &lt;vorlon&gt; upils: well there's a bug about it being wrong to use the same set of components for the image build and the post-install sources
[16:24] &lt;waveform&gt; indeed -- it shouldn't be enabled during the image build itself, but patched in at the end
[16:24] &lt;juliank&gt; I see bootstraps of any sorts are main/restricted only, and then enable universe/multiverse? before building final image
[16:25] &lt;juliank&gt; so we don't install packages from them into the image :)
[16:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: bootstraps of *Ubuntu* are main/restricted only
[16:25] &lt;upils&gt; vorlon: which is now fixed (see LP: 2038111)
[16:25] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2038111 in ubuntu-image "must be able to distinguish between components for image build and target sources.list in image definition" [Medium, Fix Released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2038111
[16:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; flavors include universe
[16:25] &lt;juliank&gt; hmm
[16:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; upils: ok :)
[16:25] &lt;enr0n&gt; Okay, well for the case of ubuntu-release-upgrader, which is *not* building images, I am going to just add universe to the default components.
[16:25] &lt;juliank&gt; +10
[16:26] &lt;enr0n&gt; I'll untag etc.
[16:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; enr0n: (and multiverse)
[16:26] &lt;enr0n&gt; vorlon: ack
[16:26] &lt;juliank&gt; And next is another enr0n thingie: bug 2055806
[16:26] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2055806 in openssh (Ubuntu) "sshd.service ssh.socket systemd-tmpfiles-setup:Before= - Missing privilege separation directory: /run/sshd" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2055806
[16:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; analysis on the bug, seemed like it was a slam dunk to fix?
[16:28] &lt;enr0n&gt; vorlon: does that mean you agree with my comment (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/+bug/2055806/comments/8)
[16:28] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2055806 in openssh (Ubuntu) "sshd.service ssh.socket systemd-tmpfiles-setup:Before= - Missing privilege separation directory: /run/sshd" [Undecided, New]
[16:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; enr0n: well it made sense to me :)
[16:28] &lt;enr0n&gt; vorlon: ack, I will upload a fix today then
[16:28] &lt;juliank&gt; +1
[16:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; so I agree but have thought deeply about it independently!
[16:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; *not
[16:29] &lt;juliank&gt; If that fails some way we can always add the After= :D

[16:37] &lt;bdrung&gt; cpete, please give me initramfs-tools vs klibc. you get vim instead. i have a pending initramfs-tools upload where i can include the fix from Skia (and yes, i missed to pick that fix)
[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; and the rest of xz-utils to zhsj

[16:38] &lt;schopin&gt; nice, I got a non-armhf regression!
[16:38] &lt;adrien&gt; vorlon: so, umockdev armhf build fails (it failed a couple minutes ago) due to t64; are there general guidance there?
[16:38] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon, ravikant_ I can take elfutils too I suppsoe
[16:38] &lt;vorlon&gt; adrien: do we need to get umockdev rebuilt? if so, make that happen.  or if we need to retest with --all-proposed, do that
[16:38] &lt;ravikant_&gt; juliank: thanks
[16:39] &lt;adrien&gt; vorlon: ack, thanks
[16:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; adrien: ah you said the build fails.  So yes, you need to make it not fail :-)
[16:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; if you're lucky that's maybe a simple retry with new apt, or a copy to the bootstrap archive and back
[16:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; if you're unlucky you should sign up to learn how to trace bootstrapping horrors with me
[16:40]  * schopin will try to attend that workshop
[16:40] &lt;adrien&gt; thanks, I'll see, it's either t64 or something else yet to be fully identified
[16:40] &lt;bdrung&gt; Skia, I included your fix in the 0.142ubuntu20 upload which is still in -proposed
[16:40] &lt;Skia&gt; bdrung: great!
[16:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; adrien: you're unlucky, umockdev depends on glib
[16:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; adrien: or maybe you're lucky, because that means you probably don't have anything to do there and maybe should leave it to mwhudson or doko or myself
[16:42] &lt;adrien&gt; haha, I'll also try to get up to speed with what's going on with glib
[16:43] &lt;vorlon&gt; adrien: there's a terrible bootstrap loop between glib2.0 and gobject-introspection
[16:43] &lt;adrien&gt; (well, at least for t64 because I never want to get deep into glib :) )
[16:43] &lt;adrien&gt; doh
[16:43] &lt;vorlon&gt; I got as far as building glib2.0 without gir
[16:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; and then I had to leave it there to work on other stuff and didn't look any deeper at bootstrapping gobject-introspection
[16:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; so jbicha reverted it because it was blocking things on !armhf in -proposed
[16:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: back to you
[16:44] &lt;adrien&gt; thanks for the summary, yeah, it's complicated
[16:44] &lt;adrien&gt; and long
[16:45] &lt;juliank&gt; #topic aob
[16:47] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; tomorrow is a public holiday in India
[16:48] &lt;bdrung&gt; and in Berlin
[16:48] &lt;juliank&gt; not here :(
[16:48] &lt;juliank&gt; but on the bright side it's going to be sunny
[16:48] &lt;juliank&gt; (pun intended)
[16:49] &lt;ravikant_&gt; It is International Women's Day
[16:49] &lt;bdrung&gt; we got this public holiday because Berlin has fewer public holidays than other regions in Germany
[16:50] &lt;juliank&gt; some celebrate women, other celebrate shiva
[16:51] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; :D
[16:53] &lt;juliank&gt; final call!

[19:57] &lt;linaporras&gt; Hi all!
[19:58] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; Hi everyone:D Â , Greetings
[19:58] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; two minutes... getting there
[19:58] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; great, I broke IRC
[19:59] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; !ping
[19:59] &lt;ubottu&gt; pong!
[19:59] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; hi arraybolt3
[19:59] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; alright, got it back :P (hit a wrong button in WeeChat)
[19:59] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; and I am finally here.
[19:59] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; hi linaporras
[19:59] &lt;oerheks&gt; !yay
[19:59] &lt;ubottu&gt; Glad you made it! :-)
[19:59] &lt;oerheks&gt; 10...9..8..7..6..
[20:00] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; -5, -6, -7...
[20:00] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; who do we have in from the board this evening?
[20:02]  * Bashing-om present
[20:02] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; me too
[20:02] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; My name is Carlos Maestre, nice to meet you everyone. IÂ´m from Barranquilla, Colombia.:D
[20:04] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; we will need to wait to see if any more members can arrive. We have three potential voters right now (1 via proxy) but we need four to meet quorum
[20:04] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; mesebrec: o/
[20:04] &lt;oerheks&gt; arraybolt3, Bashing-om, lucyllewy and me..
[20:04] &lt;oerheks&gt; we do have 4
[20:05] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I'm not on the UMB?
[20:05] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; oerheks: arraybolt isn't Larry
[20:05] &lt;mesebrec&gt; Hi everyone! o/
[20:05] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I'm here to advocate for ravage's application, not vote :P
[20:05] &lt;oerheks&gt; Larry?
[20:05] &lt;oerheks&gt; oh sorry
[20:06] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; oerheks: Larry aka Wildman :D
[20:06] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; mapreri: are you about?
[20:07] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; Kilos ^ same
[20:08] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; we need either fenris, mapreri, or Kilos to be here as well
[20:09] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; might need to petition the cc to allow cc members to vote in case they can fill a quorum quota in future meetings
[20:09] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; only additional member I see who's in the room is mapreri
[20:09] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; oh wait
[20:09] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; yup
[20:09] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I see I missed stuff
[20:10] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; somehow my IRC client stopped scrolling down.
[20:12] &lt;mesebrec&gt; Maybe ping some people via Telegram, for example?
[20:12] &lt;mesebrec&gt; I see Mattia hasn't been online here for a while, but he's online on Telegram
[20:14] &lt;oerheks&gt; Is Mark himself online?
[20:15] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; mapreri already indicated they might not make it
[20:19] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; we might have to defer the meeting :'( we have the 22:00 slot today as well if any applicants can shift, but I'm not sure if anybody extra will be able to make that who hasn't managed this meeting
[20:19] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; the alternative is the board members vote via our mailing list
[20:20] &lt;ravage&gt; i am here if needed. dont know about the others
[20:21] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; o/
[20:21] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; I would like to submit the link to my UBM application.
[20:21] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/carlos-maestre-membership-application/41783
[20:22] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; ic3br34ker77: ravage isn't on the UMB, he's seeking Ubuntu Membership this meeting.
[20:22] &lt;oerheks&gt; ic3br34ker77, thanks, nice pictures!
[20:22] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; oh, cool just like me:D
[20:23] &lt;linaporras&gt; Good idea the mailing list
[20:24] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; we're well into the scheduled hour, and I don't want to keep you if there's not much likelihood of getting the required Quorum by the end of the time slot to be able to start the meeting, so if you'd all like I can either move you to the later meeting today (1.5 hours from now at 22:00 GMT) or take the vote to email
[20:24] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; Thanks oerheks
[20:25] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; waiting is another option if you would prefer that
[20:25] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; by my side, I donÂ´t have any problem.
[20:26] &lt;mesebrec&gt; I'm not sure I understand the quorum rules
[20:26] &lt;mesebrec&gt; Membership board has 6 voting members
[20:26] &lt;mesebrec&gt; if 3 are present, isn't that enough?
[20:26] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; mesebrec: I think it is 50%+1 unless 50% is already an odd number
[20:27] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; so floor(50%+1)
[20:27] &lt;mesebrec&gt; So that's 3
[20:28] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; oops. I explained that bad. I meant integer, not odd
[20:28] &lt;mesebrec&gt; The number here is wrong because the CC is part of the team (for technical reasons) https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-membership-board/+members#active
[20:30] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; as we have 6 members it's floor((6/2)+1) = floor(3+1) = 4. if we had 7 it'ld be floor((7/2)+1) = floor(3.5+1) = 4
[20:31] &lt;mesebrec&gt; oh
[20:37] &lt;cangreja533&gt; Hello, warm greetings from Colombia
[20:37] &lt;mesebrec&gt; Ok, the Matrix Council is having a meeting now, but we can jump back here if quorum is reached
[20:37] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; ok
[20:38] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; we'll try to get things sorted via email asap if that's the decision
[20:38] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; we also still have the second meeting slot today if we can't get quorum by the end of this slot
[20:38] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; so sorry about this
[20:39] &lt;mesebrec&gt; No problem, it happens!
[20:39] &lt;mesebrec&gt; If it's a persistent problem, feel free to ask the CC for help and we can see if we can do interim elections or provide some replacements.
[20:40] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; no worries lads, It's understandable, it happens.
[20:40] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; cangreja533: Welcome - are you too going to be a participant in FLiSoL Barranquilla ?
[20:43] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; thank you, mesebrec. I'll chat with the board to see what we want to do
[20:43] &lt;cangreja533&gt; I would love to, but I am organizing FLISOL in Manizales
[20:43] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; we'll then mail the CC with those ideas and request advice or help
[20:44] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; 8) Â FliSoL Manizales, with the smell of coffeeÂ =D
[20:46] &lt;oerheks&gt; meanwhile, a fresh kernel update on 22.04
[20:46] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; cangreja533: For visibility be good to post to Discourse that Manizales will be a part: eg - https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/flisol-barranquilla-2024/42702 :D
[20:57] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; that's about the time slot finished. we'll bump everyone to the next slot in 1 hour unless you request to take your application through to email
[21:08] &lt;ravage&gt; we can wait
[21:12] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; Yeah sure.
[21:14] &lt;oerheks&gt; brb
[22:00] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; Welcome gschiano !
[22:00] &lt;gschiano&gt; Hello :)
[22:00] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; okie dokie. time for round two. hopefully we can get quorum this time.
[22:01] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; Round 2XD
[22:01] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; we need two of: Bashing-om, mapreri, Kilos, fenris
[22:01] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; I have a proxy for wildman so with two others and myself we can meet quorum.
[22:02] &lt;ravage&gt; sounds promising ð
[22:02]  * Bashing-om present
[22:02] &lt;oerheks&gt; :-)
[22:02] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; 1 met
[22:02] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; need 1 more
[22:02] &lt;gschiano&gt; Stars aligning
[22:02]  * arraybolt3 kicks stars
[22:02] &lt;ilvipero&gt; hello!
[22:02] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; hi ilvipero
[22:02] &lt;gschiano&gt; Hey ilvipero
[22:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; mapreri: has ducked out for certain
[22:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; that leaves either Kilos or fenris
[22:04] &lt;gschiano&gt; *invokes fenris* (because his name sounds like an invocation)
[22:05] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; Â Fenris woow, the mythological wolf of ragnarok.
[22:05] &lt;sarnold&gt; awoooooo
[22:05] &lt;gschiano&gt; \O/
[22:05] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; haha
[22:05] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; is "fenris" known as "myfenris" on Telegram?
[22:05] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; If so, I just pinged him
[22:05] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; yes.
[22:05] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (via #kubuntu-devel)
[22:06] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; I'm confused as to names. silly memory is broken. We need Wild_Man
[22:06] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; fenris already voted?
[22:06] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; yeh
[22:06] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; sorry about that. I can't equate people's telegram display names to irc nicks unless they are the same :P
[22:09] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; I'm sorry how do you vote? I'm also trying to vote for UM but I don't understand... apologies in advance.
[22:11] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; correction, I'm sorry how do you vote? I'm also trying to find out if you vote for me to be UM but I don't understand... apologies in advance.**
[22:11] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; The Ubuntu Membership Board votes on whether people become Ubuntu Members or not. So far we have two people here and a third has already voted in advance, we need one more person...
[22:12] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; ic3br34ker77: we need a "quorum" of board members to be able to run a meeting
[22:12] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; ...and that one more person isn't showing up yet.
[22:12] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; it's only the board members that may vote on membership applications in this process
[22:12] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; ic3br34ker77: 6 members of the board - upon examining your application each cast a yea or nay vote for acceptance. usually in this channel.
[22:13] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; ohh oh, I get it, thank you very much for clarifying, it's just that it's my first day. xD
[22:13] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; no worries
[22:14] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; thanks lucyllewy
[22:14] &lt;gschiano&gt; If fenris already voted I invoked the wrong one. I need to call for Kilos then
[22:14] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; yeh that's my fault.. I got names mixed up in my head
[22:15] &lt;gschiano&gt; *Rise, Kilos, in mystic might: unveil the hidden light!*
[22:16] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; hehe
[22:18] &lt;gschiano&gt; So without a quorum, we're in a split brain situation right ?
[22:18] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; yup
[22:18] &lt;gschiano&gt; *scale down unit 3"
[22:18] &lt;gschiano&gt; *scale down unit 3*
[22:18] &lt;mesebrec&gt; I think it's difficult to get &gt;50% of people to show up when people are in all timezones.
[22:19] &lt;mesebrec&gt; Statistically speaking, at least 50% of people will be asleep
[22:19] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; just had confirmation from WildMan that they can't make it
[22:19] &lt;gschiano&gt; Indeed
[22:20] &lt;mesebrec&gt; I think the membership board has a lot of people, to make sure enough people can show up
[22:20] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; ravage, ic3br34ker77, gschiano, can each of you choose whether you'd like to move your application to email or a future meeting?
[22:20] &lt;ravage&gt; email
[22:20] &lt;gschiano&gt; How is it processed if the application is managed by email ?
[22:21] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; we'll also contact the CC about quorum numbers and get that properly documented what we need and the calculation for that number
[22:22] &lt;gschiano&gt; Well I think email is fine
[22:22] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; gschiano: we'll vote on our internal mailing list and CC the results to each applicant as soon as we can. Sometimes we might want to ask questions, but if we can we'll vote without
[22:23] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; Guys; ravage, gschiano if you agree by mail, I'll join you too. I haven't gone home. xD
[22:23] &lt;ravage&gt; email is totally fine with me
[22:23] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; I'm so sorry to all of you for the failures today
[22:23] &lt;gschiano&gt; No worry :)Ã 
[22:24] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; can you each DM me an email you are happy for us to use if you don't have it publicly shown on your launchpad profile?
[22:24] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; email address**
[22:24] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; Email too, no worries lucyllewy it happens:)
[22:24] &lt;gschiano&gt; Any of my launchpad email address are fine
[22:25] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; gschiano: it looks like your launchpad email is hidden from public view, so I can't see it
[22:25] &lt;gschiano&gt; Ok, let me DM you
[22:25] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; cool
[22:25] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; lucyllewy my email: candres.maestre@gmail.com
[22:27] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; thank you, ic3br34ker77

[22:28] &lt;ic3br34ker77&gt; have a good one everyone. see ya!
[22:28] &lt;gschiano&gt; Thanks all, see you :)
[22:28] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; thank you so much everyone. And I'm really sorry again.
[22:29] &lt;ravage&gt; no worries
[22:29] &lt;mesebrec&gt; No worries lucy, you're amazing!
[22:29] &lt;gschiano&gt; Really no worryies

[16:46] &lt;wuzamarine&gt; I am having issues with ufw and I was hoping to get a fresh set of eyes on it. https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2495670&amp;p=14181005#post14181005 I have a second issue that I have a feeling is very much connected  https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2495836&amp;p=14181365#post14181365 and help would be dearly appreciated.
[20:43] &lt;sarnold&gt; wuzamarine: if I'm reading your posts correctly, I think you'd have more consistent results if you disable or uninstall ufw and write nftables rules by hand -- ufw is meant to be easy enough to run simple commands to enable common filtering things, but beyond a certain level of complexity it'd just be easier to manage exactly the rules you want yourself
[20:46] &lt;JanC&gt; the "u" in "ufw" stands for "uncomplicated"
[20:48] &lt;JanC&gt; there are other frontends for nftables too
[20:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; and probably way more for iptables, some of them very complicated :)
[20:59] &lt;JanC&gt; by default iptables itself is a frontend for nftables nowadays  :)
[21:01] &lt;wuzamarine&gt; sarnold the problem with iptables is that you will learn the syntax once to build a firewall and then 3 years later when you have to do the same task, the syntax changes and you have to relearn it again from scratch. At this point, I am looking for anything to make it easier.
[21:03] &lt;sarnold&gt; wuzamarine: hah, yeah, i'm familiar with that .. ipfwadm was easy enough but then they introduced ipchains. ipchains was annoying so I switched to ipf. then ipf was replaced with pf. then just when I was starting to learn ipchains they introduced iptables. and then just when I was getting around to learning iptables they introduced nftables. who even knows how long this one is going to last..
[21:11] &lt;JanC&gt; ufw has been good enough for what I need recently, but almost a couple decades ago I used shorewall; no idea how it compares nowadays...
[21:11] &lt;JanC&gt; and there are other tools/frontends too
[21:12] &lt;JanC&gt; even ufw might work for what you are trying to do, but it's been a long time since I did anything complicated with it...   :)
[21:14] &lt;JanC&gt; certainly port 25 just works for me...
[21:17] &lt;JanC&gt; (but it's probably a different ufw version)
[21:18] &lt;JanC&gt; are you certain fail2ban or knockd aren't causing your issues?

[15:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hmm, two new ones here
[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; first: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tree/+bug/2056099
[15:33] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2056099 in tree (Ubuntu) "[MIR] tree" [Undecided, New]
[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; reading the rational before we try to assign ...
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hmm - reading "this has been discussed with the Foundations team"
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon isn't around
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; What I see makes me think could it not do that while staying in universe?
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it won't be seeded, nor will it be advertised much outside of the mentioned SDK
[15:35] &lt;ahresse&gt; Hello, I posted the MIR about tree . It is my first MIR so feel free to ask me questions here.
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hi ahresse, welcome
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; try to answer the above I guess
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is mostly me trying to get if the motivation to do that is valid
[15:35] &lt;joalif&gt; o/
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hi joalif (and sarnold and eslerm_)
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; JFTR
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ahresse: what I mean is that you've written "their user experience on their Ubuntu based SDK images"
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; which is fine, but why does it have to be in main for that
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; what is the value it provides to the rest of Ubuntu, since you said "enerally useful for a large part of our user base using the command-line" over it being what it is right now
[15:37] &lt;ahresse&gt; I guess we (Canonical) concluded to support these packages officially in our partneship contract
[15:37] &lt;ahresse&gt; And getting these into main is the way to validate this
[15:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; If (IIFF) foundations is truly happy to own this, I'm ok then. This will go to some -supported seed and not be pulled in anywhere.
[15:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; since slyon isn't around and do_ko extra busy with time_t64 I'd wait until next week for them to say something instead of assigning it right away
[15:39] &lt;eslerm_&gt; doesn't the contract validate support?
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; oh eslerm_ do not get me started "support" is an undefined term to begin with
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it means 105 things to 52 different people
[15:39] &lt;sarnold&gt; it could just be that getting updates for this from esm to sdk users might be A Real Challenge
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ahresse: you could speed that up or avoid the same delay to happen again if you could ask Fundations management to comment on the bug agreeing that they will own it and that they consider this a good idea too
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ahresse: this isn't negelcting your request, but we need to validate you are not secretly putting that onto their agenda :-)
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and I'd not feel well for someon in the MIR team to review before I feel sure this will happen
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; does that work for you ahresse?
[15:40] &lt;ahresse&gt; What I noted from my meeting from Fundation was: Lukasz: low risk, not so critical. Should go with a MIR. No strong objection from Foundation.
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I totally believe you, but "No strong objection from Foundation" does not yet say "I'm ok that our team will take care for this for a decade" - although to admit this one seems low effort indeed
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; still I need to hold everything against sort of the same bar to pass
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and we had others suggesting other owning teams ... guess how those ended up
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; @MIR folks - how do you think about adding a rule to the template that enforced an ack from the to be owning team?
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I feel we almost have discussed that ...
[15:43] &lt;eslerm_&gt; ++1
[15:43] &lt;sarnold&gt; that's probably a good idea, we've had other community folks try to get teams to support (sorry) packages that they weren't interested in
[15:43] &lt;joalif&gt; +1
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, 1 sec
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; created https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/52
[15:45] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Issue 52 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "Suggested owner should provide a confirmation from the owning team" [Open]
[15:45] &lt;ahresse&gt; TBH, this is my first MIR attempt so I will just follow what you propose... Let's just summerize it on the associated LP bug at the end.
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, on tree we will recheck next week with foundations people around
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; again ahresse you can help with asking them to please comment and confirm on the bug
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; no problem ahresse, we are friendly and try to get your case resolved
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; excuse us for immediately starting with an extra whoop to jump through
[15:46] &lt;sarnold&gt; ahresse: to be clear, this is a lovely mir :)
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; indeed sarnold
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the rest LGTM in a glance
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; just in the 360 and FF week resources are scarce
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hence I'm hoolding back and want to ensure ownership before spending any
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; next to look at is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pemmican/+bug/2055434
[15:47] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2055434 in pemmican (Ubuntu) "[MIR] pemmican" [Undecided, New]
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and ahresse - thanks for being here for discussion
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that helps to speed up things - so it is highly appreciated
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; in regard to the former discussion foundations team asking to own it themselve
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; also a pattern that we had before - special Pi bits for the Pi images that need to be in main for that reason
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; joalif: do you have any capacity to consider reviewing this (I'm drowned in 360 efforts)?
[15:48] &lt;waveform&gt; sorry :)
[15:49] &lt;joalif&gt; yup
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hu, why excusing waveform
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; all good
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thank you so much joalif

[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; my issue of 4 minutes ago
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and eslerm with cargo vendor
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; reading ...
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/51
[15:50] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Issue 51 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "cargo vendor adds unnecessary crates" [Open]
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah, we need to have the toolchain folks comment
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and until then probably leave a note in the MIR policies
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; WDYT?
[15:51] &lt;eslerm_&gt; toolchains commented in the linked jira task
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; opening
[15:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; I understand there's around 80megs of windows crates in the authd packages
[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so what can we do for now, other than expecting anyone touching it to manually do the culling to those that matters?
[15:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; should we ask for those to be deleted by hand before release? shipping that to all mirrors for ten more years makes me sad :(
[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we can not say "no rust until it solved" not can we "all that is listed needs to be fully reviewed" :-/
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: with "by hand" you mean d/rules removing them along the source build and build?
[15:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; cpaelzer: exactly
[15:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; posting on the case
[15:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but I'm unsure who to wait/block/gate/assign
[15:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so what will happen now, and by whom ... ?
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; updated to ask didrocks what he thinks
[15:56] &lt;eslerm_&gt; waiting for more discussion might be a good place to wait for next week
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that was triggered by a desktop package right?
[15:56] &lt;eslerm_&gt; correct
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; authd - yeah
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; let us see what becomes of this
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; interesting for sure
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; rushing the last steps, 4 minutes to go

[15:57] &lt;eslerm_&gt; security mirs are progressing :)
[15:57] &lt;eslerm_&gt; we need a volunteer for a perl package, we'll ifnd one
[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; make them found eslerm_! :-)
[15:57] &lt;eslerm_&gt; bpf mirs are going smoothly
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I guess there is not much more to say here
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; any other around bpf (like trace and such) showing any signs of trouble?
[15:58] &lt;eslerm_&gt; yes
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; oh
[15:58] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I mention it in the spec
[15:59] &lt;eslerm_&gt; the binaries from these packages are numerous (which is fine) and duplicate each others function
[15:59] &lt;eslerm_&gt; but, those working on the spec can figure this out
[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah I've seen that if you mean libbpf-tools and bpt-tools IIRC
[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but they are from the same source - so just one effort to maintain
[15:59] &lt;eslerm_&gt; we don't want ALL of these binaries to be installed by default most likely
[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and we'd not install all
[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah
[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ack on not installing all
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; TBH only the smaller ones built with less dependencies would be my suggestions (libbpf-tools)
[16:00] &lt;eslerm_&gt; and bpftrace, it dupes bpt-tools too
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; oh
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; unexpected
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks for raising
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; rushing on then ...
[16:00] &lt;eslerm_&gt; in bpftrace's cases, I'd make the binaries examples since that is really what they are
[16:00] &lt;eslerm_&gt; examples of writing bpfc-tools with bpftrace
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; agreed, that is what I considered them
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; useful examples though
[16:00] &lt;eslerm_&gt; very
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic Any other business?
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; not from me
[16:01] &lt;joalif&gt; none
[16:01] &lt;eslerm_&gt; none
[16:01] &lt;sarnold&gt; none here
[16:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks
[16:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sorry for the rush
[16:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; two more meetings now ...

[10:17] &lt;mpiano&gt; Hi folks. I noticed that cvescan databases (https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cvescan/) stopped updating a couple of days ago. Is this just some flakiness, or did we get to the final nail in the coffin for this project?
[11:16] &lt;ebarretto&gt; mpiano, probably some issue in the server, but we should take this as the final coffin as the project has been unsupported for more than an year now 
[11:19] &lt;mpiano&gt; ebarretto, I'm ready to bet it's somehow related to handling the leap year. Anyhow, sad to see this one go for real, I guess it's time to actually switch to OVAL databases.

[15:57] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; henlo o/
[15:58] &lt;mirespace&gt; o/
[15:59] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; o/
[16:01] &lt;rbasak&gt; o/
[16:01] &lt;rbasak&gt; Sorry I'm not feeling well today. I'll be around but would appreciate if I didn't take an active role today.
[16:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; no worries
[16:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; wait, am I the only one?
[16:04] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; mirespace: :P
[16:05] &lt;mirespace&gt; hehe, I was thinking you was asking for other MDB members
[16:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; yeah, no, I was
[16:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I don't know where are others
[16:05] &lt;mirespace&gt; It seems I chose a bad slot :(
[16:06] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; mirespace: I am sorry, I was excited for today :(
[16:06] &lt;mirespace&gt; utkarsh2102: thankyou
[16:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; rbasak: should we take mirespace's application the next time
[16:07] &lt;teward&gt; o/
[16:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; or can we still start and vote for ourselves and defer the application to mail
[16:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; teward: hey, hi!
[16:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; same question to you^ :D
[16:07] &lt;teward&gt; *plays catchup as he only just got here*
[16:08] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; no rush
[16:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; So I prefer to ask hard questions, just not today. IMHO, that's valuable to help identify any gaps. If someone else could do that then I'd find it valuable to continue with the application today.
[16:09] &lt;teward&gt; utkarsh2102: if you have questions for the applicant we can have part 1 where we ask questions and then keep minutes and attach them to a ml item for us to actually vote on or have follow up questions.  Since its only us two we are nowhere near quorate
[16:09] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; fair, OK
[16:09] &lt;teward&gt; i have no issues defering because i'm multitasking on an ITSec incident too
[16:09] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; let's defer to the next meeting then :(
[16:09] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; aah, okay, definitely defer it then! o/
[16:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; Is there a suitable slot that mirespace can take that won't delay things too much?
[16:10] &lt;mirespace&gt; checking MDB agenda slots...
[16:10] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; mirespace: hope the next slot is not a problem for you?
[16:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; There's also https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/KnowledgeBase#Voting_and_Quorum which admittedly I don't quite fully understand
[16:10] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; DMB slots only please :P
[16:10] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; we don't do MDB stuff yet
[16:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; It might reduce quorum requirements next time
[16:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; But I think it only applies if we actually have the meeting today
[16:11] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; hm
[16:11] &lt;mirespace&gt; hehe...sorry, DMB... 03/18 seems next one ...ok
[16:12] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; perfect
[16:12] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; let's meet next time then! \o
[16:13] &lt;mirespace&gt; Date changed in the agenda
[16:15] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; danke
[16:15] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; see you then!
[16:16] &lt;mirespace&gt; bye
[16:16] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; \o
[16:16] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; :wq!
[16:38] &lt;seb128&gt; sorry for missing the meeting, that time of the day doesn't really work out for me :/

[16:11] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2019026 in systemd (Ubuntu) "systemd /tmp cleaning is suboptimal" [Wishlist, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2019026
[16:13] &lt;enr0n&gt; I mostly tagged this to see if people felt strongly enough that we should change the default. I took the stance of "if admin wants something different, just change the config", but I don't want to be an unnecessary blocker with my opinion
[16:13] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I'm +1 for auto cleaning and the way things used to be
[16:17] &lt;vorlon&gt; I mean, I think I made my position clear :)
[16:18] &lt;juliank&gt; I prefer the new behavior
[16:18] &lt;juliank&gt; Actually I prefer /tmp on tmpfs so I don't care
[16:18] &lt;vorlon&gt; cleaning only on boot, on systems with persistent /tmp, has some bad side effects
[16:18] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: yes so you don't get a vote ;D
[16:20] &lt;waveform&gt; I'd be quite happy to revert to the old behaviour
[16:21] &lt;bdrung&gt; /tmp is on tmpfs on my system, but cleaning it periodically will save memory
[16:22] &lt;vorlon&gt; that too!
[16:22] &lt;Skia&gt; same here, old behavior was good

[16:30] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon: you wanna go?
[16:30] &lt;juliank&gt; I don't think there's really anything new in there though
[16:31] &lt;schopin&gt; there's a hint request opened for glibc to unblock the kernel (apparmor changes broke the test suite)
[16:31] &lt;juliank&gt; All the light grey stuff will be t64 and we should not assign them _yet_
[16:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; schopin: is the hint request acked by you?
[16:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; schopin: that had been my feedback: before we break the glibc testsuite we need agreement that this should be fixed on the glibc side
[16:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: so I think frankly it's not worth assigning anything this week
[16:32] &lt;bdrung&gt; initramfs-tools looks to be dep17 related
[16:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; everything is going to explode over the next few days in -proposed

[16:33] &lt;schopin&gt; I was in the middle of this when the meeting started :P
[16:34] &lt;adrien&gt; off tomorrow
[16:34] &lt;bdrung&gt; autopkgtest/5.32ubuntu3 blocks the sbuild migration. Can someone have a look?
[16:34] &lt;bdrung&gt; (on s390x)
[16:37] &lt;bdmurray&gt; It passed?
[16:38] &lt;Skia&gt; looks like a timeout
[16:38] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I mean for it to be blocking it must have passed which is surprising
[16:38] &lt;bdrung&gt; https://autopkgtest.ubuntu.com/packages/a/autopkgtest/noble/s390x is relative green
[16:39] &lt;Skia&gt; bdmurray: yes, it passed, I fixed it, remember?
[16:39] &lt;bdmurray&gt; apparently not! ;-)
[16:40] &lt;Skia&gt; there's a retry ongoing, I'll monitor it and see what can be done about it

[15:34] &lt;slyon&gt; Any volunteers to review ^ ?
[15:34] &lt;didrocks&gt; Iâm happy to take any MIRs, I canât sign off they will be done next week though, Iâll aim for the next next one
[15:34] &lt;didrocks&gt; of*
[15:34] &lt;joalif&gt; i can take the simple-perl
[15:35] &lt;slyon&gt; simple-perl is done already AFAIC.
[15:35] &lt;didrocks&gt; it doesnât seem there is due date for ndb, so I can it

[15:35] &lt;slyon&gt; thanks, assigning to didrocks
[15:35] &lt;jamespage&gt; that ndb one is odd - its a binary only promotion for a package already in main

[15:41] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2055165 in gcr4 (Ubuntu) "Move gcr4 to main" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2055165
[15:41] &lt;jbicha&gt; hi
[15:42] &lt;jbicha&gt; we're wondering if we can avoid the whole MIR process for gcr4
[15:42] &lt;slyon&gt; jbicha: hey! Are there major code changes between gcr and gcr4? Or should it be considered a "versioned package upgrade", that does not need MIR, but just AA approval?
[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; FYI: subscription on libdbd-sqlite3-perl added
[15:43] &lt;sarnold&gt; I don't understand quite what that first paragraph is saying; if gcr doesn't include gui widgets, why do we need a separate version for gtk4?
[15:45] &lt;jbicha&gt; gtk4 apps couldn't use libgcr-ui-3-1 anyway because of its gtk3 dependency. gcr devs also chose to make some other api changes at the same time
[15:45] &lt;slyon&gt; jbicha: is gcr4 a continuation of the gcr codebase?
[15:45] &lt;jbicha&gt; slyon: yes!
[15:46] &lt;jbicha&gt; it's still https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gcr
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; usually versioned transitions can have some overlap, but eventually resolve. Is this expected to only have gcr4 at some point, if so when?
[15:46] &lt;slyon&gt; I'd assume that depends on GTK3 usage in main..?
[15:47] &lt;jbicha&gt; I can't give you an exact time since seahorse &amp; shotwell are undermaintained &amp; porting to gtk4 is a lot for big apps
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I see, so it really is once all GTK3 in main are gone some day
[15:47] &lt;jbicha&gt; the old gcr will be in universe for a long time
[15:47] &lt;jbicha&gt; yes
[15:47] &lt;seb128&gt; hey there, sorry I wanted to join but I've another call at the same time and forgot to /j on IRC
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm personally fine with that TBH
[15:48] &lt;seb128&gt; jbicha, thanks for covering for desktop :)
[15:48] &lt;slyon&gt; Considering it's a versioned transition and we have precedence for parallel GTK3 &amp; GTK4 I'm +1 on promoting this. But I'd like to defer to cpaelzer and/or didrocks for a final decision, with their AA hats on
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm +1 as well, with a twist (not too bad one, let me write ...)
[15:49] &lt;didrocks&gt; I donât think thatâs much different from gtk3 -&gt; gtk4. It would have been a good time for reviewing the package and how we can improve it, but I donât think this is doable in a realistic timeframe
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I haven't had a look, but is it reasonable to ask for improved testing and quality
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; otherwise we have to wait for GTK5  :-)
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; OTOH I totally see hwo time runs out for that
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; given that it is the same as before but newer I'm +1 even without, but couldn't resist asking for some QA and testing eyes
[15:50] &lt;slyon&gt; Let's make improved/non-superficial autopkgtest a recommendation, then?
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: yeah, that
[15:50] &lt;seb128&gt; +1, we can card that on our backlog, not going to happen for feature freeze though :)
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that is ok as a compromise - if it is before final freeze (vs the backlog being 234235346345 items long)
[15:51] &lt;slyon&gt; I updated the case on LP. status: Fix Committed

[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; on this very topic of the production-tools related MIRs
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I have ruled out two cases with  a pre-review, they will never hit the MIR queue
[15:56] &lt;slyon&gt; yes, there's overall quite some frustration about the perf tools MIRs, as the packages are not in very good shape
[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; they are in much better shape than those I eliminated upfront
[15:57] &lt;slyon&gt; ok
[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; TL;DR: I've drawn a line for some to be ok to match what common documentation mentioned, but need to stay in universe

[16:00] &lt;slyon&gt; Will double-check and merege after the meeting.
[16:00] &lt;eslerm&gt; within the authd MIR, there are comments about windows crates being vendored
[16:00] &lt;slyon&gt; eslerm: your comment from December?
[16:00] &lt;eslerm&gt; this is related to https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues/35#issuecomment-1859325671
[16:00] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Issue 35 in canonical/ubuntu-mir "RFC: Introduce 'base-sets' for vendored dependencies" [Open]
[16:01] &lt;eslerm&gt; yes
[16:01] &lt;eslerm&gt; please see comment #11 from authd as well
[16:01] &lt;eslerm&gt; I'm not sure where to take this issue beyond here
[16:02] &lt;slyon&gt; I guess there are some hints in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RustCodeInMain how to mangle the unneeded crates manually..
[16:03] &lt;sarnold&gt; that's for mangling, does it also work for deleting?
[16:04] &lt;eslerm&gt; in the best case, that is manual work for each package
[16:04] &lt;eslerm&gt; I'm not sure how well rerunning `crate vendor` works
[16:04] &lt;slyon&gt; Yes, I think it's manual work. The package should have some script to drop unneeded stuff and mangle the manifest accordingly
[16:05] &lt;eslerm&gt; and it would be ongoing manual work
[16:05] &lt;slyon&gt; I think longer term we'd need upstream toolchain support to vendor only the necessary deps
[16:06] &lt;slyon&gt; but that's not something that we have right now.
[16:06] &lt;eslerm&gt; I have links to upstream comments
[16:06] &lt;didrocks&gt; yeah, I think that should be done centrally, at worst, in the packaging tooling then
[16:06] &lt;eslerm&gt; in the MIR and issue thread
[16:06] &lt;didrocks&gt; otherwise, everyone will have different ways of doing it, hard to update and so on
[16:06] &lt;eslerm&gt; this is out of scope for cargo upstream, a thirdparty lint is likely needed
[16:07] &lt;slyon&gt; I can put it into the Foundations/Toolchain squad's backlog for review during next roadmap planning
[16:07] &lt;sarnold&gt; thanks
[16:07] &lt;eslerm&gt; thank you !

[16:08] &lt;sarnold&gt; progress is progressing :)
[16:09] &lt;eslerm&gt; we're fairly caught up. we're expecting MIRs for tracing and perl to land in our queue soon
[16:09] &lt;slyon&gt; sounds good. Let's move on as we're already overtime. All pending/ready MIRs seem to be in the queue
[16:10] &lt;slyon&gt; #topic Any other business?
[16:10] &lt;eslerm&gt; dbus-broker is very close
[16:10] &lt;slyon&gt; Is there still a change to do the dbus-broker switch in noble (cc seb128)?
[16:10] &lt;slyon&gt; chance*
[16:11] &lt;slyon&gt; I mean, it would be great the have the MIR and security review ready anyway
[16:11] &lt;slyon&gt; so we can to the change whenever needed
[16:11] &lt;slyon&gt; Do we have anything else?
[16:12] &lt;eslerm&gt; not from me
[16:12] &lt;slyon&gt; sorry for running late! o/

[16:12] &lt;sarnold&gt; nothing here
[16:12] &lt;joalif&gt; thanks slyon, all :)
[16:12] &lt;sarnold&gt; thanks slyon, all :)
[16:13] &lt;eslerm&gt; thanks everyone o/
[16:14] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: maybe you could look into demoting openjdk-21-doc?
[16:22] &lt;seb128&gt; slyon, sorry, I was off for one week and struggling to catchup/get things in Noble for feature freeze atm
[16:24] &lt;seb128&gt; slyon, I don't really understand what changed of dbus-broker, the dbus-run-session equivalent feature is being worked by someone upstream but doesn't seem at the point of being merged yet
[16:24] &lt;seb128&gt; of-&gt;for
[16:24] &lt;seb128&gt; which means we can't demote src:dbus
[16:24] &lt;seb128&gt; which is what is the basis on which the MIR team nacked the request previous cycles
[16:25] &lt;slyon&gt; seb128: sure, I can fully understand that. Considering that things are moving in the right direction (security review progressing, upstream work on the dbus-run-session equivalent), I was just wondering if there are any plans to make that switch for 24.04?
[16:26] &lt;seb128&gt; I would love to see that happen but it doesn't seem like things align enough for it?
[16:26] &lt;slyon&gt; seb128: I think most recent discussions (from last week? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dbus-broker/+bug/2015538/comments/19) revealed that we'd be willing to have it split into individual binary packages. So that src:dbus and src:dbus-broker could be in main at the same time, but only with the relevant binary packages (dbus-broker daemon + dbus policy)
[16:26] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2015538 in dbus-broker (Ubuntu) "[MIR] dbus-broker" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[16:28] &lt;seb128&gt; slyon, we had that discussion at the time we had the first review round iirc, but someone pointed out (mdeslaur?) back then that dbus-run-session depends on the dbus service
[16:28] &lt;seb128&gt; I didn't have the free slots to read the code to see if that's true
[16:28] &lt;seb128&gt; but assuming that's a true fact it means we can't do the split/demote dbus service thing
[16:29] &lt;seb128&gt; if I understand correctly what you want to split (dbus-session-run in main, dbus in universe, right?)
[16:31] &lt;slyon&gt; I think the idea was to get the upstream dbus-broker dbus-run-session equivalent integrated, so that we could demote dbus and dbus-run-session to universe, while keeping the src:dbus policy bits, which are not shipped by dbus-broker on purpose.
[16:31] &lt;slyon&gt; But doing that split and integration work would need somebody with capacity to drive it
[16:33] &lt;slyon&gt; comment #17 also suggest that there is no such hard dependency, which would give even more options: "In Debian we just keep both, dbus-run-session from the src:dbus package works just fine, and it can be installed in parallel without any issues when somebody needs it. So it doesn't seem to me that you need that separate implementation?"
[16:33] &lt;slyon&gt; But it needs checking the details
[16:35] &lt;seb128&gt; slyon, ack, thanks for the details
[16:35] &lt;seb128&gt; it's on my backlog, I doubt I will get to it this week though but I'm still interested, maybe we manage to squeeze a ffe next week for it if things turn out to not be too complicated
[16:36] &lt;seb128&gt; the fact that the new binary is written in rust is annoying it means it's not a simple patch to drop it
[17:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: I could demote it, but this needs an extra exclude or it would come just back
[17:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: it only has https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/+git/ubuntu/tree/supported#n214
[18:05] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: good catch! I'll work on that
[20:00] &lt;sil2100&gt; o/
[20:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; o/
[20:00] &lt;vorlon&gt; time_t, everybody

[20:03] &lt;rbasak&gt; I've been ill so haven't made any progress list last time, sorry.
[20:03] &lt;rbasak&gt; I was going to try and set up a higher bandwidth meeting to try to catch up on the third party repo req. stuff
[20:03] &lt;sil2100&gt; Let me carry over those then, no worries!

[20:04] &lt;sil2100&gt; So, regarding this one:
[20:04] &lt;sil2100&gt; ACTION: seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu cinnamon on 24.04 request
[20:04] &lt;sil2100&gt; Does anyone remember if that happened?
[20:04]  * sil2100 looks at the ML
[20:05] &lt;sil2100&gt; I guess not
[20:05] &lt;seb128&gt; hey, sorry for being late, evening rush time here
[20:05] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Eickmeyer and I have been interfacing with ItzSwirlz on this front.
[20:05] &lt;sil2100&gt; seb128: o/
[20:05] &lt;seb128&gt; sil2100, no, none of my action moved, sorry
[20:05] &lt;seb128&gt; I was on holidays one week and now it's feature freeze coming
[20:05] &lt;seb128&gt; I will try to catch up next week and get things moving by the next meeting
[20:05] &lt;sil2100&gt; seb128: do you need help with that one? I could also take a look at it, since I know many teams might be at capacity due to FF
[20:06] &lt;sil2100&gt; Either way, for now carrying over!
[20:07] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu cinnamon on 24.04 request
[20:07] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu cinnamon on 24.04 request
[20:07] &lt;sil2100&gt; ACTION: vorlon to look into scripting for packages in flavor-specific overlays
[20:07] &lt;sil2100&gt; vorlon: ^ ?
[20:07] &lt;vorlon&gt; sorry, not yet done
[20:07] &lt;sil2100&gt; I guess time_t..?
[20:07] &lt;vorlon&gt; yeah ;)
[20:07] &lt;sil2100&gt; time_t ;)
[20:07] &lt;seb128&gt; sil2100, no it's fine but thanks, I will catch up next week :)
[20:07] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action vorlon to look into scripting for packages in flavor-specific overlays
[20:07] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: vorlon to look into scripting for packages in flavor-specific overlays
[20:07] &lt;sil2100&gt; seb128: excellent!
[20:07] &lt;sil2100&gt; ACTION: vorlon to follow up on xnox's request to set noble.publish_i18n_index to False
[20:08] &lt;vorlon&gt; done
[20:08] &lt;sil2100&gt; vorlon: didn't follow that one too closly - I guess it happened?
[20:08] &lt;sil2100&gt; \o/
[20:08] &lt;sil2100&gt; Okay, that's all action items from our list for now
[20:08] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic Scan the mailing list archive for anything we missed (standing item)
[20:09] &lt;sil2100&gt; I don't see anything really
[20:09] &lt;sil2100&gt; Can someone else confirm that I didn't miss anything?
[20:09] &lt;sgmoore&gt; Is this the right place to ask about Kubuntu LTS requalification?
[20:10] &lt;sil2100&gt; sgmoore: sure! Let me just move to AOB
[20:10] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic Check up on community bugs and techboard bugs
[20:10] &lt;sil2100&gt; ...none!
[20:10] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic AOB
[20:10] &lt;sil2100&gt; sgmoore: the floor is yours o/
[20:10] &lt;vorlon&gt; I'm not sure whether kubuntu LTS qualification is blocked on me providing scripts for a saner view of the "what packages is kubuntu committing to support" question
[20:11] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I think given the scale of the Kubuntu packageset, if the TB is wanting to block on a more concise packageset list, then yes. :)
[20:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; ML thread "Upload of translation files" -&gt; I just replied to redirect them to ubuntu-translators@. Hopefully that's helpful, though with Gunnar gone I'm not sure who's left :-(
[20:11] &lt;vorlon&gt; the thread had gone in that direction but maybe we just need to have that information available and don't need to consider it a blocker?
[20:11] &lt;sgmoore&gt; I know we need a proper packageset, but other than that, how are we looking :) I am working hard on getting a spectacular release ready :)
[20:11] &lt;vorlon&gt; rbasak: :/
[20:13] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, I think I'm the only standing member left to deal with some of those translations things :/
[20:14] &lt;seb128&gt; I need to sort that out somehow and find other people to involve
[20:14] &lt;seb128&gt; if anyone is reading and want to help with translations please msg me
[20:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; sgmoore: so I guess amurray who isn't here today was on point for driving the Kubuntu discussion.  I'll work on getting my action item sorted one way or the other so we can have a sane conversation about a packageset. From my perspective personally, that shouldn't be a blocker for LTS qualification but amurray will need to call the vote
[20:15] &lt;sil2100&gt; The only thing I can commit to, sadly, is operating the machinery
[20:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; seb128: IMHO, you should "close" those MLs and venues and bring everything into one place - ubuntu-devel@, or Discourse. It's not like we're going to be swarmed by traffic. Otherwise everyone assumes that there's a team somewhere that's running just fine.
[20:15] &lt;sgmoore&gt; vorlon: Fair enough :)
[20:16] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, the issue is that those lists are contact point for role-accounts on launchpad
[20:17] &lt;sil2100&gt; sgmoore: out of curiosity, maybe composing a list of packages that you and your team worked on in the last 6 months when working on Kubuntu would be a start
[20:17] &lt;sgmoore&gt; I only just started back with Kubuntu a few weeks ago.
[20:17] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, I could set e.g devel but that doesn't resolve the issue than in practice the only admin in the team able to do the action is me
[20:18] &lt;seb128&gt; (or maybe launchpad admins or some other admin groups, I don't remember the details and didn't go check)
[20:18] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; sgmoore: I'll happily walk through UDD with you if you find it helpful :)
[20:18] &lt;sgmoore&gt; I find any new knowledge helpful lol
[20:19] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Okay, will follow up with you after the meeting
[20:19] &lt;sgmoore&gt; sounds good thanks!
[20:20] &lt;sil2100&gt; Okay, any other business?
[20:21] &lt;sil2100&gt; Out of curiosity, with part of my release team hat on...
[20:22] &lt;seb128&gt; nothing from me
[20:22] &lt;sil2100&gt; Does anyone have contact with the Ubuntu Mate developers?
[20:22] &lt;seb128&gt; sort of
[20:23] &lt;vorlon&gt; it doesn't appear they've applied yet for 24.04 LTS qual
[20:23] &lt;sil2100&gt; Just asking since I noticed they were a bit absent from .4
[20:23] &lt;sil2100&gt; Anyway, guess that's not a TB-topic per-se
[20:24] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic Select a chair for the next meeting
[20:24] &lt;seb128&gt; I will give a ping to Martin just to ask
[20:25] &lt;sil2100&gt; ...okay, how is this chair selection working
[20:25] &lt;sil2100&gt; Since none of the sorting of TB members results in the current order for me
[20:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; https://launchpad.net/~techboard/+members lists you last and Alex next after wrapping around
[20:26] &lt;seb128&gt; sil2100, you got rescheduled for missing your previous chair so that confused the logical order
[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Yes, so how come rbasak was the backup today
[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Aaah
[20:26] &lt;seb128&gt; :)
[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Okay, so next chair will be amurray, backup rbasak
[20:27] &lt;sil2100&gt; Thank you everyone!
[20:27] &lt;sil2100&gt; #endmeeting
[20:27] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 20:27:16 UTC.  Minutes at https://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting/2024/ubuntu-meeting.2024-02-27-20.01.moin.txt
[20:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; thanks!
[20:28] &lt;seb128&gt; thanks sil2100 for the chairing and doing in an efficient way, always good to not spend longer that needed in meetings during the rush times :)
[21:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; yw!
[23:11] &lt;amurray&gt; sgmoore: re Kubuntu LTS - I agree with vorlon, resolving the packageset is not a blocker for LTS qualification, so will call for a vote via the mailing list today - let me know though how you go with manually defining the packageset as suggested by sil2100 / tsimonq2

[12:55] &lt;Guest16&gt; Hi Ubuntu Security Team, As per https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-38430 , is it correct to say that CVE-2023-38430 is applicable only when ksmbd-tools package is installed?
[12:55] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.3.9. ksmbd does not validate the SMB request protocol ID, leading to an out-of-bounds read. &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38430&gt;
[12:58] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; Guest16: the kernel interface is likely still vulnerable even if you don't have the userspace tools installed
[14:43] &lt;JanC&gt; considering it (potentially) results in KASAN warnings (or panics, depending on config) that seems very likely
[14:45] &lt;sdeziel&gt; the CVE link has a note saying: &gt; needs ksmbd-tools installed to enable the service, which is not installed by default.
[14:48] &lt;JanC&gt; there are no other applications that can enable it?
[14:54] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; I mean, an attacker could poke at the kernel interface directly without the userspace tools
[14:55] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; not sure how "applicable" we're looking for
[14:56] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; "will my kernel crash by itself" vs "can an attacker crash my kernel even without the userspace tools installed"
[17:40] &lt;teward&gt; security team, a question regarding the OVALs came by - https://askubuntu.com/questions/1504371/ubuntu-22-04-lts-oval-missing-version-check-for-vulnerability-in-older-kernel - not sure fi this is relevant or if Security wants to respond authoritatively
[18:28] &lt;ebarretto&gt; teward, thanks for the heads up. I'm already eod but I will reply to it first thing tomorrow
[23:26] &lt;teward&gt; ebarretto: no worries, just wanted to put it on the radar i'll respond that I pushed it to the SEcurity team for handling and they're projecting to reply in the next 24 hours
[23:30] &lt;teward&gt; ebarretto: i see you already put in a reply and it got a downvote so I tossed a grenade into the ring with the "This is an official response by a member of the Ubuntu Security Team, if you downvote you should explain why" xD

[16:02] &lt;juliank&gt; busy day!
[16:04] &lt;bdmurray&gt; juliank: Is your status still live?
=== rkratky__ is now known as rkratky
[16:04] &lt;juliank&gt; no sorry
[16:05] &lt;juliank&gt; Forgot to update the timestamp
[16:05] &lt;juliank&gt; So yes, the DEP17 migration to /usr is at full steam
[16:05] &lt;juliank&gt; and should hopefully be also done tomorrow
[16:05] &lt;juliank&gt; The one for essential anyhow
[16:06]  * juliank had one primary goal: Make mmdebstrap work on noble
[16:08] &lt;bdmurray&gt; dviererbe: regarding unzip autopkgtests for i386 I've seen the same thing with gzip
[16:08] &lt;bdmurray&gt; dviererbe: I think there is a bug for that
[16:09] &lt;dviererbe&gt; bdmurray: is there anything I can do?
[16:09] &lt;bdmurray&gt; write a patch? ;-)
[16:09] &lt;dviererbe&gt; :D

[16:17] &lt;bdmurray&gt; juliank: yes, and?
[16:17] &lt;mkukri&gt; removing rustc, it's not really a bug, rustc does weird things but i think it's "by diesng"
[16:17] &lt;mkukri&gt; *design
[16:19] &lt;juliank&gt; Sorry doing DEP17 /usr move coordination in parallel
[16:19] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Focus man
[16:19] &lt;juliank&gt; Lots of talking to helmut :)
[16:20] &lt;juliank&gt; so this is fixed already and the report is out to date
[16:20] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Thursday, 22. February 2024 14:31 UTC hardly?
[16:20] &lt;juliank&gt; ugh no rustc is open, but meson is done
[16:21] &lt;mkukri&gt; removed rustc

[16:21] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I think the problem here is polkit
[16:21] &lt;juliank&gt; We already have one for tracker anyway, so let's remove that
[16:22] &lt;juliank&gt; tracker-extract crashing is in u-r-u backlog
[16:22] &lt;juliank&gt; the polkit crash could eventually crash gnome-shell
[16:23] &lt;juliank&gt; I don't really want to tag this with 3 packages as we get three JIRA issues which will be awkward
[16:23] &lt;juliank&gt; I guess desktop is doing some analysis too
[16:24] &lt;juliank&gt; I suggest we skip it until next week
[16:24] &lt;juliank&gt; maybe the culprit has been seen by then :)

[16:25] &lt;juliank&gt; fwiw I expect we'll see a bunch more diversions fail next week due to stuff from /bin /sbin moving to /usr
[16:25] &lt;juliank&gt; I'd argue the idea to make the diversion script a no-op if real script is not present is the right choice, and lets take it

[03:28] &lt;eslerm&gt; I need to retest if I missed anything in my notes tomorrow https://markesler.com/notes/smtp-smuggling/

[02:17] &lt;eslerm&gt; I setup sendmail on the vm, and configured it with a fastmail account
[02:18] &lt;eslerm&gt; a local user can conntenct to sendmail over telnet and send emails to other local users using smtp commands
[02:18] &lt;eslerm&gt; that works well, but none of the end-of-data sequences for smuggling split the email
[02:20] &lt;eslerm&gt; I believe I'm testing the wrong smuggling direction
[02:34] &lt;eslerm&gt; okay, that fits with https://www.postfix.org/smtp-smuggling.html
[02:35] &lt;eslerm&gt; I need to setup a _destination_ server to test the _inbound_ parsing https://smtpsmuggling.com/
[02:37] &lt;eslerm&gt; my current fastmail destination server must be patched

[15:36] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2023971 in libmail-dmarc-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libmail-dmarc-perl" [High, Incomplete]
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks joalif for the review
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bpfcc/+bug/2052813 I reviewed today
[15:36] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2052813 in bpfcc (Ubuntu) "[MIR] bpfcc" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is ok but with quite a few required and recommended todos
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; here in particular I wanted to ask eslerm and sarnold something
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; could you open my review and scroll to the [Security] section
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; In this case I'm not sure if I should say we need or do not need a security review
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; WDYT?
[15:38] &lt;sarnold&gt; I'm
[15:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes you are
[15:38] &lt;sarnold&gt; :D
[15:38] &lt;sarnold&gt; I'm not sure either; on the one hand, administrative privilege is required to run these, so there's a thin barrier at best
[15:38] &lt;sarnold&gt; most of the security layer happens in the kernel
[15:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes, by BPF being in isolation there
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; some isolation
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; here is the deal, if you say you do not think it is needed, my call will be it is not needed
[15:39] &lt;eslerm&gt; I'll let sarnold decide
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and then we are fine
[15:39] &lt;eslerm&gt; a quick review might remove some footguns
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; if you say, no you want - then I go that way
[15:39] &lt;sarnold&gt; I believe that this package itself is very little risk to the security team, but the kernel portion might -- so, I'm inclined to say that this doesn't need security team review
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: is there a good way to express "we should have a quick check but not a full reivew"
[15:40] &lt;eslerm&gt; likely :)
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hehe
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; how about you volunteer for that "quick but not full" check
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; then the solution is that I'll assign you
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; actually it is back with mkukri so I'd subscribe you
[15:41] &lt;eslerm&gt; a short audit might find something useful to report upstream, it might just be bugs, if the security context cannot be made worse by bugs
[15:42] &lt;eslerm&gt; I can do that
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thank you
[15:42] &lt;eslerm&gt; (i.e., only bugs exist if you are already root, not vulnerabilities)
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; you are subscvribed
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; "subscribed"
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; next is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dbus-broker/+bug/2015538
[15:42] &lt;mkukri&gt; oh anything is fine by me as far as these MIRs go
[15:42] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2015538 in dbus-broker (Ubuntu) "[MIR] dbus-broker" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:43] &lt;mkukri&gt; current plan is for me to address the TODOs next week and hopefully get it uploaded by FF
[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks mkukri if only we'd have known that we could dump anything on you as part of this :-P
[15:43] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: so you helped get the apparmor delta upstreamed into Debian dbus-broker? We should be able to drop the Ubuntu delta then, right?
[15:43] &lt;mkukri&gt; "these MIRs" as in the ones already assigned, anything extra will have to go through foundations managers, am afraid :)
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes slyon the Debian maintainer is helpful and friendly, he asked for that delta even
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and on the bug he helped to explain to resolve some of the discussions
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; like not ever fully replacing dbus anyway because dbus-run-session from the src:dbus package works just fine
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that directly addresses a concern of eslerm
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and overall makes this more likely to work out
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I have no good overview of what else is left open here, but it could go back to seb128 to reconsider
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; jbicha: ^^ could you pass that info on please as seb seems to not be around atm
[15:45] &lt;sarnold&gt; should we then ask for a split of src:dbus into one package for dbus-run-session, one package for the policy/config/deps that bluca mentions, and one package (for universe) for the daemon that we want to demote?
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: IMHO no, we have packages where we explicitly say "this binary in main, the rest not"
[15:46] &lt;sarnold&gt; cpaelzer: hah, I see I forgot the word 'binary' in there
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; doing that here is much smaller maintenance effort than keeping a huge delta splitting the source
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; oh
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah, that "splitting the binaries to just keep what we want in main" would be a good next step then
[15:47] &lt;eslerm&gt; +1
[15:48] &lt;slyon&gt; +1
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I added a comment on the bug
[15:48] &lt;eslerm&gt; a rust vendored version of dbus-broker-session is also needed, right?
[15:48] &lt;slyon&gt; I also just synced the dbus-broker package
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thank you for the discussion
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes eslerm, that is one of the known required todos
[15:48] &lt;eslerm&gt; dbus-broker-session is still in PR iiuc
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; interesting
[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; https://github.com/bus1/dbus-broker/pull/321

[15:49] &lt;slyon&gt; but bluca mentions we could keep using dbus-run-session (if it is split into an separate binary anyway)
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; got a review by slyon
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ack slyon, that is how I understood it too
[15:50] &lt;eslerm&gt; ah, ack
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; So I guess this is just back to the requesting team to resolve required TODOs
[15:50] &lt;slyon&gt; gnome-snapshot has quite some TODOs for jbicha. I wonder if we should already get this into security-queue, as it seems time sensitive?
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it will go to the security reivew
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so you might want to add that to the queue already despite being back for open tasks
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hehe
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we thought alike slyon
[15:50] &lt;slyon&gt; hehe
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: eslerm: WDYT?
[15:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; yeah, we should be pulling things forward as we can
[15:51] &lt;eslerm&gt; I prefer things hitting our queue early
[15:51] &lt;jbicha&gt; I'll forward this conversation to Seb but I believe he won't be able to respond this week
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, do it!

[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yet another review done, thanks didrocks
[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; again having lots of required and some recommended TODOs
[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that is back on Paul for now
[15:52] &lt;eslerm&gt; should security review this while others are working on TODOs?
[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; a bit symbols, plenty of testing .- just like bpfcc actually
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this again was called to need a review
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so yes, to bring things forward I think it would be great to add that to the queue already as well
[15:53] &lt;slyon&gt; upils: is working on this actively
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I need to keep time in mind, so I'll go on
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but this section was very worthwhile today

[15:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that was jbicha requesting that, he might know if that is of current priority or not

[15:56] &lt;eslerm&gt; I have one more question

[15:56] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2052495 in wsl-pro-service (Ubuntu Noble) "[MIR] wsl-pro-service" [Undecided, Confirmed]
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; not to be considered an order
[15:56] &lt;eslerm&gt; is any special consideration needed for promoting to older LTS'
[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, I know a bit of that context
[15:57] &lt;jbicha&gt; yes, we'd like to get fdk-aac-free into main for Noble. I will ping my Fedora contacts today about the fork being outdated
[15:57] &lt;slyon&gt; eslerm: so far the package is not even available on older series... so I would ignore it for now?
[15:57] &lt;eslerm&gt; thanks jbicha
[15:57] &lt;eslerm&gt; ack, thanks slyon
[15:57] &lt;eslerm&gt; so, our review would not be acking old LTS then ?
[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the consideration we had in the past
[15:57] &lt;slyon&gt; the owning team should request MIR for the older series once it's ready
[15:58] &lt;eslerm&gt; sounds good to me
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: but here they requested it right away
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; they did spell out that this will immediately go back to older releases
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; what we have done in that case in the past
[15:58] &lt;slyon&gt; eslerm: yes. We'll probably have the same version backported to older LTS (I assume)... so an follow-up MIR for older LTS should be easy
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; was looking if that adds any special issues
[15:58] &lt;sarnold&gt; cpaelzer: wsl currently plays no part in any of the testing anywhere in the companym, as far as I can tell: there's no britney, none of the security team tests have ever been tested in wsl, etc. it's always felt like a "well, if it works, that's neat" sort of thing
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; like, dependencies or the context no more working
[15:59] &lt;sarnold&gt; cpaelzer: it's weird to me to be considering selling pro for wsl without having the basic testing story covered
[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and then we have said "this is ok, also for those releases"
[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: this is for pro in wsl as you say, and that is actually tested daily and on any change by the Desktop team owning this agent and by the pro team it is tested as well from the other POV to this
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; pro on wsl, does not make this story any different
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we could also say we need tests on each cloud, each container stack, ... then
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but we do not
[16:00] &lt;eslerm&gt; I believe security can proceed with only Nobel in mind (a conditional ack for just 24.04 if needed) while this is all worked out
[16:00] &lt;sarnold&gt; can windows execute systemd yet?
[16:01] &lt;sarnold&gt; as far as I know, the clouds can, and some of the containers do, some do not..
[16:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; to be clear, you can have a lot of things in WSL already, even pro works there. But it isn't called that way and this makes it able to enable it more smoothly.
[16:01] &lt;slyon&gt; sarnold: I remember helping with systemd support for wsl in the past, so probably yes
[16:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes, it can in some environments
[16:02] &lt;sarnold&gt; I seem to recall lucy making it work, but does the thing that we or microsoft ship work?
[16:02] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it isn't as bad as you might think :-)
[16:02] &lt;sarnold&gt; I think comparing it to a new architecture is perhaps the better comparison
[16:02] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but again, this request is only for an agent that makes enabling pro possible in smoother ways
[16:02] &lt;sarnold&gt; sure
[16:03] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is not "let us create Ubuntu for WSL, what should we do"
[16:03] &lt;sarnold&gt; I'm asking the larger question
[16:03] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; those are questions to be asked, but not as part of this MIR
[16:03] &lt;sarnold&gt; cpaelzer: just promise me that someone is asking these questions of the right people
[16:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: you send me a mail summarize with what you want to be asked and I make it happen
[16:04] &lt;sarnold&gt; cpaelzer: awesome, thanks :)
[16:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I have quite some ties to many people, probably all that need to hear that
[16:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok
[16:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thank you all, I need to close
[16:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm too late already ...

[19:06] &lt;rbasak&gt; vpa1977: welcome!
[19:06] &lt;vpa1977&gt; thank you =)
[19:06] &lt;rbasak&gt; vpa1977: would you like to introduce yourself?
[19:07]  * kanashiro waves
[19:07] &lt;vpa1977&gt; Hi my name is Vladimir and I am working on Java packages in Ubuntu.
[19:07] &lt;vpa1977&gt; I have been involved in development for the past year and before that worked on commercial software.
[19:08] &lt;vpa1977&gt; Most notable item is Together (old uml modelling tool) =)
[19:08] &lt;vpa1977&gt; at least for me =)
[19:08] &lt;sil2100&gt; #link https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi?render=html&amp;sponsor=*&amp;sponsor_search=name&amp;sponsoree=Vladimir+Petko&amp;sponsoree_search=name
[19:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks! Let me get started. When is feature freeze please, and how would you find that information?
[19:09] &lt;vpa1977&gt; I will be looking at https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-schedule/35649
[19:09] &lt;vpa1977&gt; The current deadline is 29 feb
[19:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; If you need a feature freeze exception, what's the process?
[19:10] &lt;vpa1977&gt; I will be raising a bug explaining the need for the feature freeze, proposed changes and their impact
[19:10] &lt;vpa1977&gt; I will provide a test plan and subscribe ubuntu-release
[19:10] &lt;vpa1977&gt; *need for the feature freeze exception
[19:11] &lt;vpa1977&gt; The bug will have a debdiff/MP attached and the associated test logs
[19:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. Let's say that we have version 1.2-3 packaged, upstream have released 1.2.1, and feature freeze is in effect. Would an upload of 1.2.1 be permitted without an exception, or, if you need more information, what information would that be?
[19:12] &lt;vpa1977&gt; I will review changelogs to identify if it is a bugfix release
[19:12] &lt;vpa1977&gt; In this case it is allowed to request a feature freeze
[19:12] &lt;vpa1977&gt; exception
[19:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. Let's say that it is a bugfix release. What package versions string would you expect to use for your upload?
[19:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; *package version string
[19:13] &lt;vpa1977&gt; It depends if it is Ubuntu specific or debian package. For ubuntu it will be 1.2.1-0ubuntu1 for debian it will be 1.2.1~us1-0ubuntu1
[19:13] &lt;vpa1977&gt; reason for ~us1 is that original tarballs are not reproducible in some cases
[19:13] &lt;vpa1977&gt; and the repack suffix will allow sync with debian
[19:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; Good answer :)
[19:14] &lt;vpa1977&gt; (not reproducible e.g. when used xz compression)
[19:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let me move on to transitions
[19:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; In the usual case, how would you verify if an upload you're considering making would introduce a transition or not?
[19:15] &lt;vpa1977&gt; The transition will happen when there are API/ABI changes in the package providing a build dependency (e.g. time_t)
[19:15] &lt;vpa1977&gt; Or the toolchain changes such as Java 21
[19:16] &lt;vpa1977&gt; *build or runtime dependency
[19:17] &lt;vpa1977&gt; In this case all dependant package will need to migrate together to ensure that there are no breaks
[19:17] &lt;sil2100&gt; I'll have an unrelated question when you're done
[19:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let's say that the package is src:foo, which generates binary package libfoo1. You're about to update a new major version of src:foo, and you have a test build ready in a PPA. Is there something you can see easily by inspection from the web UI that would instantly tell you if there's an ABI break if this is a normal case with nothing special going on?
[19:19] &lt;vpa1977&gt; From the web UI i can the major version change, but I would be looking at reverse-depends and reverse-depends -b to see if it has any dependencies
[19:19] &lt;vpa1977&gt; and rebuild those /autopkgtest in the ppa
[19:19] &lt;vpa1977&gt; I apologise if I am taking the long route here.
[19:19] &lt;vpa1977&gt; But library bumping a major version indicates some kind of break
[19:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; It doesn't necessarily mean it's an ABI break.
[19:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; What would be the difference, in terms of binary packages generated?
[19:21] &lt;vpa1977&gt; Meaning what constitutes the ABI break? Change of function parameters, removal of a function
[19:21] &lt;vpa1977&gt; Change of the exported structures
[19:21] &lt;rbasak&gt; Assume that it is correctly declared by the packaging
[19:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; What would be externally visible in the packaging that would indicate the ABI break?
[19:22] &lt;vpa1977&gt; as in from launchpad UI ?
[19:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm suggesting that it's possible to see from Launchpad web UI what I'm asking for, yes.
[19:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; Assuming you have a PPA test build ready
[19:24] &lt;vpa1977&gt; hmm... I fail to answer that ;( without looking inside package / at the sources ;(
[19:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK let's move on.
[19:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; sil2100: you said you had a question?
[19:25] &lt;vpa1977&gt; (please share the answer later =) )
[19:25] &lt;sil2100&gt; Yes, I had an SRU related question!
[19:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; I see that you did do a few SRUs, but I just want to make sure. When requesting an SRU, the template requires putting a "Where problems could occur"/"Regression Potential" section
[19:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Can you tell me what is the purpose of it?
[19:27] &lt;sil2100&gt; What do we want the SRU requesters to do as part of the preparation of this section?
[19:28] &lt;teward&gt; *shows up late*
[19:28] &lt;teward&gt; (I had no internet until now sorry, technician was on site fixing the fiber link)
[19:28] &lt;vladimirp&gt; sorry disconnect
[19:29] &lt;vladimirp&gt; Not sure if the answer got through : the section identifies extended test plan that tries to identify possible regressions/impact on users due to the change
[19:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; Thanks o/
[19:30] &lt;sil2100&gt; I have no further questions
[19:31] &lt;kanashiro&gt; all the answers so far and the endorsements are enough for me to vote
[19:32]  * rbasak is pondering whether he has further questions
[19:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; vladimirp: let's say that an upload might have resulted in a component mismatch. Where would you confirm whether this is the case or not, and what are the options available to resolve a component mismatch?
[19:33] &lt;vladimirp&gt; Lets say I have introduced a dependency on main package which is currently in universe.
[19:34] &lt;vladimirp&gt; In this case I will need to go through MIR process first to move my dependency from universe to main before uploading the package.
[19:34] &lt;vladimirp&gt; I can rollback the change by uploading the fix that removes the dependency (if possible)
[19:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK, thanks.
[19:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm ready to vote.
[19:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; teward: do you have any questions?
[19:35] &lt;teward&gt; nope, on account you and others have asked the questions I had :)
[19:35] &lt;teward&gt; and also apologies for my being late, I hate being late but when I have no internet...

[19:45] &lt;teward&gt; yeah carry that sorry
[19:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; tsimonq2: go ahead please
[19:46]  * rbasak needs to step away for three minuts
[19:46] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; &gt; sil2100 to better document what we expect applicants to know, at last an initial draft and then pass over to rbasak (will be carried until mentioned)
[19:46] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; So, I have something small started for this.
[19:46] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/resources-for-development-related-tasks/42544\
[19:47] &lt;sil2100&gt; o/
[19:47] &lt;sil2100&gt; Thank you for working on this!
[19:47] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; My pleasure :D please do make edits if you see them! I'll be working on it as time allows, ideally before the next DMB meeting.
[19:47] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; *see the opportunity for them
[19:47] &lt;sil2100&gt; It's a good start I see
[19:48] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Anyway, I'll be here for the next meeting, if you all would like to discuss further progress at that point. :)
[19:48] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; sil2100: thanks :)
[19:48] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; (EOF)
[19:48]  * rbasak is back
[19:49] &lt;rbasak&gt; tsimonq2: that looks great. Thank you!
[19:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; tsimonq2: I don't know if you're aware of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RobieBasak/DMB/CoreDev
[19:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; That's just my opinion - I think we were hoping to try and get that adjusted according DMB consensus and then share that more widely.
[19:50] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; rbasak: Nope, but now I am :D this is meant to be a shorter reference anyway, with links to something like that.
[19:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; That would be fine I think. The issue (at the DMB end) is that we vary in opinion, but that makes it hard for applicants.
[19:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; It'd be nice to find/negotiate common ground, tweaking as necessary, and have an official DMB opinion.
[19:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; Anyway, thank you again for working on this.
[19:51] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I documented this for Lubuntu a while back: https://git.lubuntu.me/lubuntu-wiki/wiki/wiki/lubuntu-dev - might be worth exploring.
[19:51] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; rbasak: I completely agree :) thanks for considering it!
[19:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; Indeed - that looks like it'd be useful input to a final DMB opinion too!
[19:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; Anything else on this to discuss for now?
[19:52] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I'm good if you all are good :)
[19:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; Any other business?
[19:54] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; vpa1977 wanted to know the answer to the question about transitions that rbasak asked?
[19:54] &lt;rbasak&gt; The binary package generated would have changed from libfoo1 to libfoo2. That's what triggers a "normal" transition - libfoo1 would become uninstallable (and/or NBS) were the package to migrate.
[19:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; Though I think vladimirp might have already understood this and it was just a mismatch in communication!
[19:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; I find it quite hard to phrase questions to avoid that sort of thing, without giving away my expected answers.
[19:55] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; which is exactly what happened to me when you hit me with a near-identical question last January
[19:56] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; :P
[19:56] &lt;vladimirp&gt; I was thinking - I have a package to review and needs to find if it contains an ABI break.
[19:56] &lt;vladimirp&gt; Could have mentioned abi-compliance-checker (but its a nightmare)
[19:57] &lt;vladimirp&gt; Plus C++ only
[19:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; arraybolt3: indeed :)
[19:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; I guess the meeting's done though then?
[19:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; #endmeeting
[19:57] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 19:57:47 UTC.  Minutes at https://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting/2024/ubuntu-meeting.2024-02-19-19.06.moin.txt
[19:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; Feel free to carry on chatting if you'd like. I welcome feedback on how I ask questions, too!
[19:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; Though I need to go now. I will catch up later.
[19:58] &lt;kanashiro&gt; o/
[19:58] &lt;teward&gt; tsimonq2: i'm stealing you btw
[20:01] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; teward: ok lol
[20:06] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; rbasak: Part of the difficult thing about being on the DMB is, in order to ask the right questions, you need to know your audience for the questions. Many assumptions can be made through reviewing debdiffs, but until there is something clear saying "this is a MOTU, this is a Core Dev," the DMB has a large amount of flexibility on what it can ask.
[20:06] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Now, I'm not suggesting we go full Debian Developer and have pre-written questions. There should, however, be something saying "these are the kinds of questions you can expect."
[20:07] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; If there's one thing I've heard from candidates privately that sticks out, it is "I'm scared for the meeting because they could ask anything," and quite honestly, that's the truth. As an existing Ubuntu Developer, it's fun to see, but I remember it being a very anxiety-prone process to go through.
[20:08] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; That was the catalyst for writing that reference document above, to get something solid started on this front, to benefit every applicant that comes after Vladimir.

[16:06] &lt;slyon&gt; adrien: oh wait... this is not about sbuild, just plain autopkgtest-virt-lxd
[16:07] &lt;adrien&gt; yeah, it's an uncommon setup; and it's kind of complicated: sbuild tries to run schroot inside an ephemeral lxd and there's obviously no schroot set up and I don't know if I'm missing something or if it's broken

[16:16] &lt;schopin&gt; do we support installs without lsb-release?
[16:17] &lt;juliank&gt; this is for jammy
[16:17] &lt;juliank&gt; and it should depend on lsb-release
[16:18] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Yes, but we should just back port bdrung's patch.
[16:18] &lt;vorlon&gt; note that adding dependencies in an SRU has a higher bar of scrutiny
[16:19] &lt;vorlon&gt; vs switching to /etc/os-release which we know we can rely on in jammy
[16:19] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I think it does depend on lsb-relese
[16:19] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok
[16:19] &lt;juliank&gt; we agreed to backport, I tagged it
[16:20] &lt;juliank&gt; And ff is empty

[16:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; top of list is update-motd which I am annoyed to see there and I have just uploaded the fix
[16:23] &lt;bdrung&gt; apport should resolve itself by today's upload of 2.27.0-0ubuntu7
[16:23] &lt;vorlon&gt; pyyaml vs crmsh: sounds like crmsh is in hand with Skia from last week, please follow through
[16:23] &lt;Skia&gt; sure
[16:23] &lt;vorlon&gt; iso-codes vs pycountry was also with Skia ; I think bdmurray had pinged me with a request for input and I had to punt
[16:24] &lt;schopin&gt; apport vs py3.12 has been presumably been fixed in -proposed
[16:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; do we need to have someone else look at this besides / in addition to Skia?
[16:24] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I've asked Skia if it is worth keeping the new iso-codes given pycountry breakage.
[16:24] &lt;Skia&gt; I'm sure it's needed, I'm following the work on this with the help of bdmurray
[16:25] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Skia: which it is needed?
[16:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; schopin: you have ansible* marked as 'done' from last week but autopkgtest regressions still show; please retrigger?
[16:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; or reopen / fix better :)
[16:25] &lt;Skia&gt; bdmurray: to have someone else look at this? did I misunderstood something?
[16:26] &lt;schopin&gt; vorlon: I split the card in two (investigation vs implementation) as requested by Ravi (or Samir?) as the implementation is substantial.
[16:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; I don't see mention of python3-defaults vs booth being assigned previously. bdmurray: let's give this to Tim
[16:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; schopin: so do you have the "implementation" card assigned to you and in this pulse?
[16:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; you do
[16:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; sorry for missing it
[16:27] &lt;schopin&gt; No worries.
[16:27] &lt;Skia&gt; vorlon: I think the preliminary investigation pointed that to also being the fault of crmsh, but that would require confirmation
[16:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; Skia: "that"?
[16:27] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Skia: I just prefer precision as opposed to it and its that are misinterpretable.
[16:27] &lt;Skia&gt; vorlon: booth vs python3-defaults
[16:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; Skia: ok well I think it should still be investigated in parallel given the time constraints
[16:28] &lt;Skia&gt; sure
[16:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; python3 vs dolfin/dolfinx-mpc I understand is with ginggs
[16:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; + fenics-dolfinx
[16:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; and possibly the Miami Dolphins
[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; and the French dauphin
[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; gpiozero is with WaVeR
[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; no
[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; gpiozero is with waveform
[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; I'm gonna try to go fast here to get to the new stuff so please yell if any of these need to be handed off otherwise I'm assuming the current assignments are good and on track for resolution by next Thu
[16:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; which NEEDS TO HAPPEN so we can get the python3 transition through and make room for other stuff before DebianImportFreeze
[16:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; jupyter-notebook is dbungert
[16:30] &lt;ginggs&gt; i believe gpiozero is fixed
[16:30] &lt;dbungert&gt; correct, I expect that done today
[16:30] &lt;waveform&gt; gpiozero should be fixed by the 2.0.1 upload this morning, so I'm free for another
[16:30] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; I have looked at python-werkzeug vs onionshare before
[16:30]  * juliank prefers to chase down all his gnupg 2.4 regressions fwiw
[16:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; python3-defaults vs lamassemble is not listed as currently assigned; adrien please take?
[16:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; libapache2-mod-python is with dviererbe
[16:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; meson is with mkukri
[16:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; passenger is with mateus-morais
[16:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; pyflakes is not previously assigned; bdrung please
[16:32] &lt;bdrung&gt; ack
[16:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; pygrib is not previously assigned; bdmurray please
[16:32] &lt;bdmurray&gt; blah
[16:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-ansible-compat - schopin do you know offhand if this is related to the other ansible stuff and should be included
[16:33] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I think I added it to big_packages with no success
[16:33] &lt;schopin&gt; vorlon: dunno but sounds likely.
[16:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-ansible-compat: schopin but if it's unrelated please feel free to raise a flag to get it broken out to someone ele
[16:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; +s
[16:34] &lt;adrien&gt; I like that proposed migrations leads one to discover new packages (very often scientific ones surprisingly :) )
[16:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-django-debug-toolbar assigned to rkratky
[16:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; also python-django-extensions
[16:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-mitogen assigned to enr0n_
[16:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; all, please commit time as soon as possible to get these fixed so the release team doesn't have to chase them over the next week to get python3-defaults migrated
[16:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-oauth2client is with ogayot
[16:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-hug is "waiting" for an i386 autopkgtest, I'll look at that
[16:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; coreutils: this was a security team upload now stalled. cpete please?
[16:36] &lt;cpete&gt; ack
[16:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; glib2.0 is entwined w/ python3-defaults indirectly via gobject-introspection
[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; dpkg: xypron please
[16:37] &lt;xypron&gt; ok
[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; glibc: schopin do you have this, do you need any release team support?
[16:38] &lt;schopin&gt; I have this, I'll ask for hinting as all actual regressions are already carded and scheduled for investigation post FF (too much to land beforehand)
[16:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; "waiting" for feature-check&gt; this has gone awol and doesn't even show on update_excuses.html, I'll retrigger
[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; llvm-toolchain-14 vs pygments: juliank please
[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: make that pygments as a whole please
[16:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; there's also llvm-toolchain-14 vs protobuf: slyon ?
[16:41] &lt;slyon&gt; ok
[16:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; have just retriggered missing tests for dh-cargo; ginggs please give that to me explicitly for follow-up
[16:41] &lt;ginggs&gt; vorlon: ack
[16:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; tzdata: upils?
[16:41] &lt;bdrung&gt; i'll take tzdata
[16:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok
[16:42] &lt;upils&gt; oh ok
[16:42] &lt;bdrung&gt; tzdata just needs some tests retriggered
[16:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; pushkarnk: do you want to *continue* looking at python-werkzeug vs onionshare or do you want someone else to take this?
[16:42] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; I can continue
[16:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok
[16:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; and that's the list
[16:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; thanks
[16:43] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank:
[16:44] &lt;bdrung&gt; vorlon, apport 2.27.0-0ubuntu7 is in the new queue (for the new binary package (for systemd-coredump support)). can you have a look?
[16:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; bdrung: ack will look
[16:44] &lt;juliank&gt; #topic AOB
[16:44] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Monday is a US holiday
[16:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; ginggs: btw adios2 is also blocked by fenics-dolfinx and blocks python3-defaults
[16:45] &lt;ginggs&gt; vorlon: ack
[16:45] &lt;vorlon&gt; ginggs: also slepc4py :)
[16:46] &lt;vorlon&gt; and the last thing I can see right now from update_excuses that's not assigned wrt python3-defaults is unity ftbfs on armhf
[16:46] &lt;vorlon&gt; ah due to a builder going away
[16:46] &lt;vorlon&gt; so retriggered

[15:31] &lt;jamespage&gt; o/
[15:31] &lt;sarnold&gt; good morning
[15:31] &lt;slyon&gt; nullboot and python-cssselect should be ready
[15:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; let us cheeck
[15:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; they are approved at least by the color
[15:32] &lt;slyon&gt; yes, that's what I did earlier today :)
[15:32] &lt;slyon&gt; besides those, kexec-tools looks new to me
[15:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes, they can be promoted
[15:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'll do so tomorrow if no one beats me to it
[15:32] &lt;slyon&gt; thanks!
[15:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; i'm surprised the kexec-tools owner is ~canonical-ubuntu-qa
[15:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; I expected kernel team ;)
[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is the kernel team
[15:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; (maybe foundations..)
[15:33] &lt;slyon&gt; It shows ~kernel-packages for me
[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/m-r-package-team-mapping.html
[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; some are subscribed by multiple which breaks some checks
[15:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; aha
[15:34] &lt;slyon&gt; but yes, QA is subscribed, too
[15:34] &lt;sarnold&gt; I was going by bug subscribers https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kexec-tools
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this is added in kexec-tools (1:2.0.25-1)
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;   * Added build dependency on libxen-dev so kexec would work on xen
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;     (Closes: #1023270)
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the merge didn't revert that change and made it Ubuntu delta kexec-tools (1:2.0.28-0ubuntu1)
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but probably needs to
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; We lack a kernel person to ping
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; let me see who uploaded that ...
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kexec-tools/1:2.0.28-0ubuntu1
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; xnox: did
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hi xnox, do you think we should remove the recommends to xen from kexec-tools or do you want to pursue this in any other way?
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; The rest of the component mismatches are known cases that are being worked on or false-positives
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic New MIRs
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&amp;orderby=-date_last_updated&amp;field.status%3Alist=NEW&amp;field.status%3Alist=CONFIRMED&amp;assignee_option=none&amp;field.assignee=&amp;field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; There are two more from the production/crisis-tools set
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we last week consumed three of them, some already done some still in flight
[15:37] &lt;slyon&gt; I can take one of the desktop MIRs
[15:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; handing you the snapshot
[15:38] &lt;slyon&gt; ack
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hmm
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hard to spread the others
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; jamespage: can I pass you one as well today?
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; to balance the load?
[15:40] &lt;eslerm&gt; bpf bugs mention they are WIP, but the outstanding issues seemed small enough that I encourged submitting them (missing unit tests)
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; joalif: seems not to be here yet but last week had already a second assigned - so probably full too
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I completed mine this morning (last minutes)
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; There are two ways we can do this
[15:41] &lt;eslerm&gt; I wouldn't mind foing a review for the MIR team if that is okay
[15:41] &lt;eslerm&gt; doing*
[15:41] &lt;joalif&gt; sorry I am here but at 2 mtgs in teh same time and didnt say hi
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hehe
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; np joalif, how possible or not is it to take another reivew?
[15:41] &lt;joalif&gt; If you cannot find anyone else assign a bug to me but then again no promises for next week
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; joalif: as long as not all of them are piling up and are done never it is ok to take a while each
[15:42] &lt;jamespage&gt; cpaelzer: yep
[15:42] &lt;joalif&gt; ok then
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I assigned langtable to joalif
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks jamespage - giving you bpftrace
[15:42] &lt;joalif&gt; ack
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and myself taking bpfcc
[15:43] &lt;jamespage&gt; ta
[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; That clears the list
[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; to all of us, good luck in finding an efficient review time
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic Incomplete bugs / questions
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&amp;orderby=-date_last_updated&amp;field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&amp;field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&amp;field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok we see the libtrace* things going back
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; mostly being great and ok actually, but missing some better QA
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; one done by didrocks, one by me
[15:45] &lt;slyon&gt; cc upils: ^
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: of the team prefers, there is the option to do autopkgtests once and awesome just on the high level
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I suggested to that in my review
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; like
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; a) get the build time tests to be better, seems didrocks found the same in his review
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but also
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; b) autopkgtests are weak
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but for (b)
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that can be done in-pkg
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; or it can be done on the level that pulls it in, which here is trace-cmd
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; there is might be easier to write non trivial tests
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and if made sure that this uses both libs, that might be adressing 3-for-1
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; all other incomplete cases in this list are much older
[15:47] &lt;slyon&gt; right. This is for upils to look into. Potentially doing proper autopkgtests for trace-cmd only
[15:47] &lt;sarnold&gt; tracing the autopkgtest runner kernels might be a challenge
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah slyon, if done right that would cover all three at once
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: we have testcases which spawn VMs to have control and avoid weird effects
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this could be another one of those
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; mark them big to have enough mem/cpu and set it up that way
[15:48] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; o/ MIR team! Sorry to butt in, I just wanted to bring this to your attention: https://tracker.debian.org/news/1493585/accepted-ubuntu-dev-tools-0198-source-into-unstable/ - I am quite happy to accept any feedback if you have it. :)
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; not saing it has to be that way, but it helps to have control and avoid flakyness
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hi tsimonq2, you are totally fine to interrupt
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; having a look ...
[15:49] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Those are just some slight tweaks I found useful for check-mir. Anyone in ~ubuntu-dev is welcome to upload to ubuntu-dev-tools in Debian as a team upload.
[15:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; cool :)
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; tsimonq2: thanks
[15:50] &lt;slyon&gt; tsimonq2: without looking at the code, those sound like very useful additions! thanks :)
[15:50] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; My pleasure. :)
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, getting to git next
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we had landed some
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; let us look at the queues
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic Process/Documentation improvements
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Mission: Review pending process/documentation pull-requests or issues
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/pulls
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #link https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir/issues
[15:50] &lt;upils&gt; hi. thanks for the suggestion. This approach is new to me to I will probably ping some of you at some point for some details in the implementation. I have no idea how much work this is.
[15:51] &lt;upils&gt; *so I will
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; only the old "need to work on it once we have time" cases on github
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok upils, that is only fair
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks for driving this
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; you might look at other tests doing that, I think systemd does - any others one immediately remembers?
[15:52] &lt;upils&gt; not quite sure I will have time to work on it this week but maybe next one
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sure upils, while we should try to avoid getting too late - promotions/demotions are not strictly bound by feature freeze
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; better go slow and do it right if in doubt (as long as we do not miss noble)
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic MIR related Security Review Queue
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Mission: Check on progress, do deadlines seem doable?
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Some clients can only work with one, some with the other escaping - the URLs point to the same place.

[15:54] &lt;slyon&gt; bug #2052495 is ready for security review

[15:54] &lt;sarnold&gt; pro on wsl, interesting :)
[15:55] &lt;sarnold&gt; at the moment things feel like we've got a decent handle on the list of outstanding mirs
[15:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ack sarnold, there are time limits for sure
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and pro on wsl is not only interesting it is also great :-)
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; will you add it to the jira board?
[15:56] &lt;upils&gt; ack cpaelzer sarnold, that should be manageable before Beta Freeze I think
[15:56] &lt;sarnold&gt; yeah, we'll add it
[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks
[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the rest on the board looks sane
[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; glad to see that
[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic Any other business?
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; not from me
[15:58] &lt;slyon&gt; nothing here
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; mirespace: is still on writing the wrapper for libcrpytx
[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; actually mirespace, I know you are unavailable now but please answer later - is the new version that does not use ed uploaded already to promote the full stack for now?
[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; as the rest adding it with the openssl wrapper is for "later" anyway
[15:59] &lt;sarnold&gt; one small item here
[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; go sarnold while I check these perl libs ...
[15:59] &lt;sarnold&gt; the flowchart on https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-mir has a lot of html formatting codes in it
[15:59] &lt;sarnold&gt; this feels new :)
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hehe
[16:00] &lt;sarnold&gt; I'm hoping that this is an obvious "oh I know how to fix that" for someone around here
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah, it was cleaner than that for sure
[16:00] &lt;slyon&gt; I wonder if dviererbe can help with that... I can reach out to hin
[16:00] &lt;slyon&gt; him*
[16:01] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; sarnold: It's being interpeted as a string, Markdown is formatted into HTML to be rendered, thus it's a matter of telling the renderer "hey, actually render this as HTML!" :)
[16:01] &lt;sarnold&gt; I forgot to open an issue last time I spotted this :/
[16:01] &lt;sarnold&gt; tsimonq2: if only the browsers would inspect the content they've been delivered and ignore the MIME types they were told to use, I'm sure there's no ill consequences of this choice :)
[16:01] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; :D
[16:02] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I suspect this will help: https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html#markdown-formatting
[16:02] &lt;sarnold&gt; anyway that was it for me
[16:02] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; This is a good one
[16:02] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; All I have for AOB is, thank you for your work, MIR Team! :D
[16:02] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; let us wait what dviererbe will say
[16:02] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks tsimonq2, same to you and all others contributing to Ubuntu out there!
[16:03] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; since slyon will reach out we can consider this as "it will happen"
[16:03] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks
[16:03] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, that seems to be a wrap
[16:03] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and I'm too late to the next meeting
[16:03] &lt;sarnold&gt; thanks cpaelzer, all :)
[16:03] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; closing ...

[20:11] &lt;vorlon&gt; I suggest we drop this from here and that I track it elsewhere, since I'm the one who was arguing for it
[20:11] &lt;vorlon&gt; and haven't had time to follow through
[20:12] &lt;amurray&gt; would it be worth filing at https://bugs.launchpad.net/techboard to track this?
[20:12] &lt;vorlon&gt; only if you think the TB wants to keep track of it IMHO
[20:12] &lt;vorlon&gt; since it was my proposal, it's more useful for me to track the TODO elsewhere
[20:13] &lt;amurray&gt; I don't think the TB needs to track it
[20:14] &lt;amurray&gt; I'll drop it from the agenda then

[20:16] &lt;amurray&gt; ah ok  - I'll keep plowing through the agenda to make sure we don't miss anything
[20:16] &lt;amurray&gt; ACTION: amurray to send confirmation of successful LTS status for UbuntuKylin 24.04
[20:16] &lt;amurray&gt; done - https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002870.html
[20:17] &lt;amurray&gt; ACTION: sil2100 to review the lubuntu LTS participation request and follow up as appropriate (question or call for vote)
[20:17] &lt;amurray&gt; I'll put that as carry over too then
[20:18] &lt;amurray&gt; oh actually I forgot we already voted via email
[20:18] &lt;amurray&gt; so it just needs someone to send the confirmation email from what I can tell
[20:19] &lt;amurray&gt; I can do that then
[20:19] &lt;seb128&gt; I guess since Lukasz was doing the review he should do the emailing?
[20:19] &lt;seb128&gt; or that :)
[20:19] &lt;amurray&gt; I'm fine either way
[20:19] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Didn't vorlon follow up giving an official ack? :)
[20:19] &lt;vorlon&gt; I think I did?
[20:19] &lt;vorlon&gt; yes
[20:20] &lt;seb128&gt; oh yes, I went over that email but the conclusion is several screen down and I didn't scroll all the way :p
[20:20] &lt;amurray&gt; ah right - sorry I wasn't looking at the right one either - https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-February/002877.html
[20:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-February/002877.html
[20:20] &lt;amurray&gt; thanks vorlon
[20:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; yah
[20:20] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; &lt;3
[20:20] &lt;amurray&gt; ACTION: seb128 to send confirmation of successful LTS status for Ubuntu Budgie 24.04
[20:20] &lt;seb128&gt; that's done
[20:20] &lt;amurray&gt; as seb noted above this is done already
[20:21] &lt;amurray&gt; ACTION: vorlon to confirm TB agreement to launchpad-buildd-admins ownership change
[20:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; done
[20:21] &lt;amurray&gt; this was done in https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-February/002876.html
[20:21] &lt;amurray&gt; ACTION: amurray to follow up with Kubuntu on 24.04 LTS request
[20:21] &lt;amurray&gt; this is still ongoing
[20:21] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; o/ I'm a stand-in for Kubuntu today, and just wanted to provide some context (nothing actionable.) Scarlett Gately Moore has been working for the Kubuntu Council now, officially, on a contract basis. I have been tasked with guiding her through so she re-learns the ropes. There has been enough progress and energy in the Kubuntu Team where I am confident in saying we should be re-qualified. I'm
[20:21] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; happy to answer any specific questions if there are any today, because I have been deeply involved in this effort.
[20:22] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Rik is still around and involved, providing guidance on the precedent he has set over the past few years, to be clear.
[20:23] &lt;amurray&gt; hey tsimonq2 - at this stage I don't have any specific questions, I'll probably just continue to follow up via email - I did notice scarlett said they would intend to support the entire kubuntu packageset (which is great!) but I worry about whether they have the resources for this?
[20:23] &lt;vorlon&gt; that all seems reasonable, and Kubuntu is established enough that I'm personally not worried about a change of lead impacting the LTS qual
[20:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; amurray: could you elaborate as to what's in the kubuntu packageset that's not KDE?
[20:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; we do a poor job of gardening packagesets
[20:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; there's probably a bunch of stuff listed that doesn't even exist in the archive anymore
[20:25] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; vorlon: I understand this isn't necessarily what we want to do going forward, but yes, that list has quite grown over time.
[20:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; doesn't have to be done here and now, anyway; this could be a mail followup
[20:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; but I'd like to get into the nitty-gritty of the capacity concerns
[20:26] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Not a problem :)
[20:26] &lt;amurray&gt; ok (fyi the packageset is quite long https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/jbYsvvfVgq/ so I assume the kubuntu folks might want to scope their statement of support a bit)
[20:26] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think a flavour packageset is a poor list to use outside of DMB managed ACLs because they are (were) automatically produced
[20:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/packagesets/noble/kubuntu btw
[20:27] &lt;rbasak&gt; ...and they might change arbitrarily for the same sort of reason in the future
[20:27] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I'll follow up on our end to see if Rik had a particular rhyme or reason.
[20:27] &lt;amurray&gt; ok, we'll continue this via email then
[20:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; rbasak: unfortunately it's the best proxy we have for "things in this flavor that aren't also in a base seed" without additional coding that we've never bothered doing.  But I agree
[20:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; tsimonq2: I look forward to you elaborating on your support plan for cvs
[20:28] &lt;rbasak&gt; The task of fixing the scripts is years old and not taken now. The DMB currently just adjusts them manually on request.
[20:28] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; vorlon: lol :)
[20:28] &lt;rbasak&gt; So there's no longer really any assurance that packages in there aren't in a different seed. Nobody is checking for that.
[20:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; uh you can give me an action to look whether we have any ubuntu-archive / ubuntu-release bits that would let me say "this bit is the flavor-specific overlay"
[20:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; because what we want to see is set(kubuntu-seeds) - set(platform-seeds)
[20:29] &lt;amurray&gt; #action vorlon to look into scripting for packages in flavor-specific overlays
[20:29] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: vorlon to look into scripting for packages in flavor-specific overlays
[20:30] &lt;amurray&gt; ACTION: vorlon to confirm ratification of Lubuntu LTS
[20:30] &lt;amurray&gt; as noted above, this was already done
[20:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; well. set(kubuntu-seeds) - set(platform-seeds) - set(ubuntu-seeds)
[20:31] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic Scan the mailing list archive for anything we missed (standing item)
[20:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; xnox asked for a change in LP
[20:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; yes
[20:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; which he pointed out that my previous request for apt maintainer sign-off was unfortunately on a superseded mp and thus "lost" to the stream
[20:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; with my AA hat on I have 0 concerns about dropping this if apt itself doesn't use it
[20:32] &lt;rbasak&gt; I wanted to know who would be taking responsibility for the change, dealing with any fallout, etc, and I don't think I got a clear answer to that.
[20:32] &lt;amurray&gt; yep - I'm not sure how to proceed here - there is clearly some perceived risk in this change but its not clear to me who owns it
[20:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; I will as an AA
[20:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; give this to me as an action please
[20:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; Great - thanks!
[20:33] &lt;amurray&gt; thanks vorlon
[20:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; (TBH I think despite the acl being owned by the TB this could have just been handled directly with the AA members of the TB rather than involving the TB as a whole)
[20:33] &lt;amurray&gt; #action vorlon to follow up on xnox's request to set noble.publish_i18n_index to False
[20:33] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: vorlon to follow up on xnox's request to set noble.publish_i18n_index to False
[20:34] &lt;amurray&gt; I don't see anything else on the mailing list for today
[20:34] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic Check up on community bugs and techboard bugs
[20:34] &lt;amurray&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-community/+bugs?field.assignee=techboard
[20:34] &lt;amurray&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/techboard
[20:35] &lt;amurray&gt; nothing here either
[20:35] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic Select a chair for the next meeting (next from https://launchpad.net/~techboard/+members)
[20:35] &lt;amurray&gt; looks like its me and rbasak as backup
[20:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; ack
[20:35] &lt;amurray&gt; #agreed next meeting chair: amurray, backup: rbasak
[20:35] &lt;meetingology&gt; AGREED: next meeting chair: amurray, backup: rbasak
[20:36] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic AOB
[20:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; o/
[20:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; the covention is that it be sil2100 with rbasak as backup, but ok :)
[20:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; +n
[20:36] &lt;amurray&gt; oh cool
[20:36] &lt;amurray&gt; #agreed next meeting chair: sil2100, backup: rbasak
[20:36] &lt;meetingology&gt; AGREED: next meeting chair: sil2100, backup: rbasak
[20:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; (i.e. missing your chair spot doesn't get you off the hook for chairing :)
[20:37] &lt;amurray&gt; does anyone else have AOB? otherwise rbasak the floor is yours
[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; This relates to "snap-MIRs" here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1apUKR4gtOrfPGCWmtoebaQUhoy-fG8Cyo3VKJyhnpD0/edit#heading=h.whx7oqqnxsv0
[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; Our previous discussions are summarised and linked from there. This is the only thing that might be holding up the main body text. To make progress I'd like to: 1) decide if it really needs to be general, because if we can agree that it's snap-specific then we can progress on the main body at least; 2) meet in a higher bandwidth medium (Google Meet?) with amurray and maybe seb128, sil2100, whoever
[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; else wants to be involved to actually get something drafted that works for us.
[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; This might be homework for you for next time to remind yourself of the previous conversation, but maybe it's worth mentioning here in public that I'd like to resolve this out-of-band and come back with a result to present in public in order to get something into the draft that's workable for everyone. I'd still expect a final vote / ratification here in public regardless so I don't think there need
[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; be any concerns about not being public enough with the work on this.
[20:38] &lt;amurray&gt; sounds reasonable to me
[20:38] &lt;vorlon&gt; +1
[20:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks. I'll set up a meeting then. Anybody else who'd like to be involved, please contact me.
[20:40] &lt;amurray&gt; we already have an action item on the agenda around this so I won't add any additional one
[20:40] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, I had that action item but I'm happy for it to grab it if you have time to move that forward
[20:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; seb128: I think that was on a different point - snap tracks?
[20:41] &lt;amurray&gt; yeah we have 2 similar items on the agenda - one is about track usage and the other is about test plans for third-party apps - this is about the second one
[20:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; We could try and combine them to make scheduling easier
[20:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; Approximately the same set of people need to discuss them anyway
[20:42] &lt;amurray&gt; sure
[20:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; So you can leave it with me to schedule something
[20:42] &lt;amurray&gt; thanks rbasak
[20:42] &lt;seb128&gt; ah, right, sorry ... but yeah, might be more efficient to cover both topics in one meeting
[20:42] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, thanks!
[20:43] &lt;amurray&gt; anything else for today...?
[20:43] &lt;vorlon&gt; nothing here
[20:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; Nothing else from me. Thanks!
[20:44] &lt;seb128&gt; not from me
[20:44] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Thank you all for
[20:44] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; ...what you do :)
[20:44] &lt;amurray&gt; thanks folks

[04:47] &lt;blahdeblah&gt; Sometime I should tell you about my experiences with Snyk and some of the completely ridiculous vulnerability reports it generates.
[04:51] &lt;amurray&gt; hey blahdeblah - thanks - sure, I'd love to hear about it :)

[22:24] &lt;Juest&gt; hey
[22:24] &lt;Juest&gt; what's happening with keyserver.ubuntu.com?
[22:24] &lt;Juest&gt; somehow my secring.gpg is getting nulled when i run --refresh-keys
[23:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; Juest: that's very weird indeed https://paste.debian.net/1306823/
[23:51] &lt;Juest&gt; sarnold: oops, i meant to say that the keyring corrupts when i refresh keys
[23:51] &lt;Juest&gt; on a different distro
[23:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; Juest: heh, i figured that you might have meant pubring instead..
[23:51] &lt;Juest&gt; using latest gpg
[23:51] &lt;Juest&gt; yeah probably
[23:52] &lt;Juest&gt; still, very weird that it still happens after recreating it multiple times

[12:27] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so let's start
[12:27] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #meetingtopic Ubuntu LoCo Council Meeting 2024-02-09
[12:28] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; do we want to add something to the order of work?
[12:28] &lt;youngbin&gt; we have meeting agenda. maybe you want to use #topic command to set agenda item
[12:29] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic Review CC Meeting on 2023-09-26 and derived subtopics
[12:29] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes .. wanted to know about the new loco portal progress
[12:29] &lt;youngbin&gt; #link https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/loco-council-meeting-schedule-and-agenda/42037
[12:29] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; coolbhavi: we will add that to the end
[12:29] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Thanks
[12:31] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so reviewing the summary
[12:31] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I see that there was a lot about the LoCo Council reboot
[12:31] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; including shedule for meetings
[12:32] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; are we all confortable with this schedule?
[12:32] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1
[12:32] &lt;youngbin&gt; +1
[12:32] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; +1
[12:32] &lt;kanashiro&gt; +1
[12:32] &lt;youngbin&gt; btw what agenda are we currently discussing?
[12:33] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; Review CC Meeting on 2023-09-26 and derived subtopics
[12:33] &lt;youngbin&gt; #topic Review CC Meeting on 2023-09-26 and derived subtopics
[12:33] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic Review CC Meeting on 2023-09-26 and derived subtopics
[12:34] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; since I'm the chair I don't know if the bot will take into consideration your entries
[12:34] &lt;youngbin&gt; yup i think so
[12:35] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so I propose we continue to use the current schedule for meeting every month?
[12:35] &lt;mapreri&gt; hello, sorry I'm late!
[12:35] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; or do you feel we should meet more often?
[12:35] &lt;youngbin&gt; hello!
[12:36] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; hi mapreri?
[12:36] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Hello mapreri
[12:36] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Current schedule looks good for me
[12:36] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; his this day of the week and time of the day good for meetings?
[12:37] &lt;mapreri&gt; monthly's good
[12:37] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok
[12:37] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; I think once or  twice a month
[12:37] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; is good
[12:37] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; I agree with mapreri
[12:37] &lt;youngbin&gt; either once or twice a month im good with both :)
[12:37] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; lets start with once, we can increase if needed
[12:37] &lt;youngbin&gt; +1
[12:38] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; +1
[12:38] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; +1
[12:38] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; I agree too and I am flexible with the timings too
[12:38] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1
[12:38] &lt;mapreri&gt; for timings, I normally can do any time, I have very few things I can't move around.
[12:38] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok so I don't think there's anything else on this topic, do you agree?
[12:38] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes
[12:38] &lt;youngbin&gt; yup i think we can move on to next topic
[12:39] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic LoCo Council Communication
[12:40] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so besides using discourse, to announce hour meetings and decisions, how else, should be communicate and for what purposes?
[12:40] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; I am active on Matrix and it just suits me better for quick chat
[12:40] &lt;youngbin&gt; maybe we can have a public room on ubuntu matrix server
[12:40] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we should definitively use that
[12:41] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I heard something being worked on by Mauro, or the intetion for it
[12:41] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Rest I think discourse and mailing lists are fine..
[12:41] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; do any of you know more about it?
[12:41] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; youngbin: any idea?
[12:41] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; how about the not official member of Ubuntu can access matrix?
[12:41] &lt;youngbin&gt;  i would also like to ask should we keep rebooter group on telegram or ask people in that room to new matrix room later?
[12:42] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; there was the intention to move I believe
[12:42] &lt;mapreri&gt; totally pls keep telegram, until there are enough people on matrix, at least (I'm not yetâ¦ :( )
[12:42] &lt;youngbin&gt; mIk3_08: you can join the room with non ubuntu.com account :)
[12:42] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we can bridge it maybe
[12:42] &lt;youngbin&gt; mapreri: surely we can do things slowly
[12:43] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; youngbin. Thanks
[12:43] &lt;youngbin&gt; agreed we an setup bridge until all folks moved to matrix
[12:43] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so lets follow up with Mauro, on that, and setup the bridge when we have the matrix channel
[12:43] &lt;mapreri&gt; oh the topic of discourse, I think as council we should monitor ("watch") several boards - should we keep a list of somewhere of what all of us are supposed to monitor?
[12:44] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes.. anyway since youngbin is active on matrix.. can have a quick chat anytime
[12:44] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; mapreri: we should definitively, all those rellated with LoCo's
[12:44] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; That is good idea mapreri.
[12:44] &lt;mapreri&gt; like, apparently https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/locos/loco-support/156 + https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/locos/docs/130 + â¦ like the meeting agenda, that was posted in the mail board, but I don't want to subscribe that as it would notify for all suboards?
[12:45] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Discourse.. keeping a list of pages is required I think for any loco team update tracking
[12:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; maybe we can also do a regular report of LoCo activity, not just on discourse
[12:45] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1
[12:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; keep an eye also on the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter
[12:46] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1
[12:46] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; +1
[12:47] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so we can mabe open a pad every week and contribute to it
[12:47] &lt;youngbin&gt; discourse have notification so maybe we can just subscribe to category. loco report activity on other places also sounds good
[12:47] &lt;mapreri&gt; DiogoConstantino: mhh, activity of what are you talking about, sorry?
[12:47] &lt;mapreri&gt; of each loco?
[12:47] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I would say anything we find relevant
[12:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; it doesn't need to be all
[12:48] &lt;mapreri&gt; mh, I fear you are too optimist :)
[12:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; just the things we find more interesting
[12:48] &lt;youngbin&gt; btw are we on "Review the LoCo (re)validation procedure" topic?
[12:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; something different that a LoCo is doing
[12:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; youngbin: not yet
[12:48] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; :-D mapreri
[12:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; still on communication
[12:48] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Like ubucon updates for instance..
[12:49] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; or some new iniciative
[12:49] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1
[12:49] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; an inovation
[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so maybe we can come up with proposals for this
[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; in writting
[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; for next meeting
[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and we vote on it
[12:50] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Would love to have a discussion on structuring of loco teams some day
[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; do you agree?
[12:50] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1
[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; +1
[12:51] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok
[12:51] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so also still regarding communication
[12:51] &lt;youngbin&gt; so we're going to collect loco activities on pad?
[12:52] &lt;kanashiro&gt; sorry guys, I had a last minute concurrent meeting but I am reading the backlog
[12:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; youngbin: the idea is to come up with a proposal on what to do about it
[12:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; a vote on it next month
[12:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I feel the concept needs to be developed
[12:53] &lt;mapreri&gt; my take on that is that my loco really has no such wide/interesting activities that are worth reporting monthlyâ¦ even yearly.  We are basically mostly carrying on.
[12:53] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; that's what we want to change
[12:53] &lt;mapreri&gt; so asking for "reports" is imho both a "push to actually do more interesting stuff" and "damn they want me to do paperwork"
[12:53] &lt;mapreri&gt; not sure what wins of the two
[12:53] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Can we send proposals and ideas on mailing list or do you prefer elsewhere?
[12:54] &lt;kanashiro&gt; which mailing list?
[12:54] &lt;mapreri&gt; indeed, this should be flashed out elsewhere, not in this meeting
[12:54] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; there's a LoCo council mailing list
[12:54] &lt;youngbin&gt; so i understand the purpose is that we want to have some insights of what locos are doing?
[12:54] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; but let's put them on discourse
[12:54] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; :)
[12:55] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; mapreri
[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I'll create a topic on that
[12:55] &lt;mapreri&gt; ty
[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and we can post it there
[12:55] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Thanks
[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; is it ok?
[12:55] &lt;kanashiro&gt; I believe we first need to understand how healthy are the locos to then try to take any action to improve them, not sure if you guys have an idea about how locos are doing
[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I have on some
[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; not all
[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; most are incipient at this point
[12:56] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and some are letargic
[12:56] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; some are however very active
[12:56] &lt;kanashiro&gt; sharing those things would be great for the new people like me :)
[12:56] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; *are very
[12:56] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Can we have a survey a general one covering the issues and pain points if any for a start?
[12:56] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; that's a good idea
[12:57] &lt;kanashiro&gt; that'd be a good start IMO
[12:57] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; +1
[12:57] &lt;youngbin&gt; yup soduns like good idea :)
[12:57] &lt;youngbin&gt; +1
[12:57] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1
[12:57] &lt;kanashiro&gt; +1
[12:57] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok we shall prepare one
[12:57] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes
[12:58] &lt;mapreri&gt; that's likely point 5 of this meeting? kindaâ¦
[12:58] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; each of us come up with questions, and we can make a final version next month
[12:58] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Seems good
[12:58] &lt;youngbin&gt; sounds good. do we want to organize some action items before moving on?
[12:58] &lt;mapreri&gt; but of course, I agree.
[12:58] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; well lets just reorganize and go back to the topics
[12:59] &lt;mapreri&gt; please.
[12:59] &lt;youngbin&gt; ok
[12:59] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; cool DiogoConstantino..
[12:59] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; continuing on communication
[12:59] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; how do we promote/communicate the idea of LoCos?
[12:59] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and where?
[12:59] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; this is also part of our mission
[13:00] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; can we maybe do an Ubuntu On Air session?
[13:00] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Social media and in opensource conferences and on YouTube?
[13:01] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 for ubuntu on air
[13:01] &lt;youngbin&gt; we can think about what loco do first. what loco usually do would be gathering folks interested in ubuntu and foss in their region
[13:01] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; that's a good idea, there's a lot we alreay know
[13:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; but maybe we don't know a lot
[13:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I do know a bit about Europe
[13:02] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Exactly
[13:02] &lt;kanashiro&gt; at least for me (who is new to this subject in Ubuntu) it is hard to say when I do not understand well who we are trying to reach out exactly. That's why I mentioned that understanding the current state would help in any further action
[13:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; also what Lina reported from Colombia
[13:02] &lt;kanashiro&gt; but I understand you guys have more knowledge than me on this
[13:02] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 to kanashiro here
[13:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; it seems that we are not ready to talk about promotion at all to me
[13:03] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok
[13:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; first step is listing out what we have (locos , then work from there.
[13:03] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Lets develop from grassroots level first
[13:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; first step is listing out what we have (locos + what they are doing right now), then work from there.
[13:03] &lt;kanashiro&gt; +1
[13:03] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok
[13:03] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; +1
[13:03] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1
[13:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; about that
[13:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; do tell
[13:04] &lt;mapreri&gt; we have a loco-council@lists.ubuntu.com private mail list, which I believe nobody subscribed us to.  I'm sure we will eventually need that private thing.  Should I liaise with IS to take it over?
[13:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; yes please
[13:05] &lt;mapreri&gt; (i have a previous experience on taking over MLsâ¦)
[13:05] &lt;youngbin&gt; Oops my network on laptop got disconnected:(
[13:05] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; I am on that list from over 10 years
[13:05] &lt;mapreri&gt; coolbhavi: do you have the admin pw?
[13:05] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Because of my last term
[13:05] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; me, in my loco. im doing some fbpage. sad to say. only few followers i have in ubuntu page in social media.
[13:05] &lt;youngbin&gt; Agreed with mapreri said before mentioned before mailing list
[13:05] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so we all agree
[13:05] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; nice
[13:06] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; mapreri: I am afraid I lost it as it got inactive 7 years ago
[13:06] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; let's just do the vote on the bot thing
[13:06] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; i agree with mapreri too.
[13:06] &lt;youngbin&gt; And yes, I also agree with mailing list for some private thing
[13:06] &lt;kanashiro&gt; sorry guys, but I will need to leave in around 5 minutes. I'll read the notes/backlog later

[13:07] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; on your proposal
[13:07] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Thanks kanashiro .. btw
[13:08] &lt;mapreri&gt; oh good, yes +1 :P
[13:08] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; to first get to know
[13:08] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; then promote
[13:08] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes
[13:08] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; i have to go people. Thanks! cheers.
[13:08] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I'll try to make it more obvious next vote
[13:08]  * kanashiro says goodbye to everyone o/
[13:09] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; do you all have to go?
[13:09] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we can leave the rest for next meeting if you do
[13:09] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; I can stay on
[13:09] &lt;youngbin&gt; Can stay more too
[13:09] &lt;mapreri&gt; I'm also here
[13:09] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok
[13:09] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so lets continue
[13:10] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; on to the next topic
[13:10] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic Review the LoCo (re)validation procedure
[13:10] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I see this was already done:
[13:10] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-local-community-verification/36573
[13:10] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I just wanted to review with you all
[13:11] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and see if we should keep it as is, or is any major change we feel we should do right now
[13:11] &lt;youngbin&gt; one questions, should verification-expired loco go through re-verification or fisrt time verification process?
[13:12] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I believe re-verefication
[13:12] &lt;mapreri&gt; I think we currently have like, 1 or 2 verified locos?  pretty much everything needs to be re-verified
[13:12] &lt;mapreri&gt; which makes sense, considering how much changed in the past decade
[13:12] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Ah this one I think we can do it on the terms of ubuntu members team for instance once verified then autorenewal for 2 years with reports to the loco council on the progress
[13:13] &lt;youngbin&gt; ð
[13:13] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Verification I find a discourse thread easier
[13:13] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I agree
[13:13] &lt;mapreri&gt; from that post I only have 1 point
[13:13] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; do tell
[13:13] &lt;mapreri&gt; "Add a short overview of the activities undertaken in the LoCo over the past 6 months with links to showcase the same. This can include blog posts, event reports, photos, etc."
[13:13] &lt;mapreri&gt; 6 months feels wrong
[13:13] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; why?
[13:14] &lt;mapreri&gt; too short for me
[13:14] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; 1 year then
[13:14] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; how long would you feel confortable and why?
[13:14] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Like the previous year maybe
[13:14] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; With summary of all activities
[13:15] &lt;mapreri&gt; and they should also talk about future plans (like we ask for previously verified which missed the deadline)
[13:15] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1
[13:15] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from coolbhavi
[13:15] &lt;mapreri&gt; DiogoConstantino: do a #endvote pls
[13:15] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #endvote
[13:15] &lt;meetingology&gt; Voting ended on: +1
[13:15] &lt;meetingology&gt; Votes for: 5, Votes against: 0, Abstentions: 0
[13:15] &lt;meetingology&gt; Motion carried
[13:15] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; forgot that
[13:16] &lt;mapreri&gt; should I just edit the post?
[13:16] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so write a proposal and lets vote on that
[13:16] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I like it too
[13:16] &lt;youngbin&gt; for me past 1 year also sounds good. for loco done something big. such as UbuCon Asia, Europe. they might got exhausted and want some rest.
[13:16] &lt;mapreri&gt; oh I can't edit it.  Aaron being superuser always makes me forget thatâ¦
[13:17] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 youngbin
[13:17] &lt;mapreri&gt; we should ask for us to be admins in https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/locos/docs/130 to be able to edit the first post or something.
[13:17] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; mapreri: we can do that latter
[13:18] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; just type here what you propose
[13:18] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and we vote
[13:18] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; then we can pursuit the rest
[13:18] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; 1 year timeframe for reverification report
[13:19] &lt;mapreri&gt; change point 2 of the verification process with "Add a short overview of the activities undertaken in the LoCo over the past year, with links to showcase them; this includes blog posts, event reports, photos, etc.  Also talk about the future plans of your LoCo."

[13:20] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok
[13:21] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; lets move on to the next topic
[13:21] &lt;mapreri&gt; the text after #vote is the "title" of what we are voting on
[13:21] &lt;mapreri&gt; (and such text gets carried over to the minutes)
[13:21] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ah ok
[13:21] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic Increasing visibility of the rebirth of the LoCo Council
[13:22] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so do we need to do something about this, and how?
[13:22] &lt;mapreri&gt; (so no "#vote +1" does not cast a vote; the "+1" needs to be the first chars of the line)
[13:22] &lt;youngbin&gt; DiogoConstantino: so it's about promoting that we're back?
[13:23] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; yes
[13:23] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; For this we can do a team meeting and stream on Ubuntu on air maybe?
[13:23] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Including the usual discourse social media and uwn
[13:24] &lt;mapreri&gt; I think we could do such thing, pulling in LoCo leaders, etc, after having a list of such locosâ¦
[13:24] &lt;youngbin&gt; AMA on UbuntuOnAir? discourse, social, blog, uwn also good way to promote
[13:24] &lt;mapreri&gt; an AMA could be good.  with the loco leaders :P
[13:24] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes
[13:24] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we can also use it to announce the survey
[13:24] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes
[13:25] &lt;youngbin&gt; yups agreed that we should reach out loco leaders first. im actually trying to reach out VN loco (since fossasia happening in Hanoi early April)
[13:25] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so the idea is to do an AMA on Ubuntu On Air, and announce the survey?
[13:26] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes
[13:26] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok lets vote on it

[13:29] &lt;meetingology&gt; Motion carried
[13:29] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; next topic?
[13:29] &lt;youngbin&gt; yups
[13:29] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic Identification of existing LoCoâs and prospective LoCoâs
[13:30] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so this is pretty much what we also want to do with the survey, but the propective LoCo's is also in here
[13:30] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we also want to know what people need to take the next step
[13:31] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and become an official LoCo
[13:31] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I feel it's slightly different
[13:31] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; the issues might be different
[13:31] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and the help we can spare might also be different
[13:31] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Survey and manual reachout will help here I guess.. as far as I remember there was a tool called locolint which checked the basics of active or inactive last time I was around
[13:32] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we should split this into two paths/groups of questions on the survey
[13:32] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; coolbhavi: I never heard of that before
[13:33] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; should be this? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil/LoCoLint
[13:33] &lt;youngbin&gt; https://launchpad.net/locolint i think so...?
[13:34] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we can try to check it
[13:34] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes
[13:34] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; https://launchpad.net/locolint
[13:34] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; but this is more for the (re)validation I believe
[13:35] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; or ?
[13:35] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes but more features can be added
[13:36] &lt;mapreri&gt; I really don't think we need to be so analytical about the current LoCo tbh.
[13:36] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so anyway we can use the Ubuntu On Air to appeal LoCo Leaders to contact us and prospective Loco teams as well
[13:36] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; at FOSDEM, we tried to promote LoCo's so I expect something to come from that
[13:37] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 maperi as we are just restarting :)
[13:37] &lt;youngbin&gt; agreed with mapreri. and what DiogoConstantino done at fosdem sounds good :)
[13:38] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Same here
[13:38] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so no specific action point besides the appeal on the stream, right?
[13:38] &lt;youngbin&gt; me and coolbhavi plan to have booth on fossasia too we can also do LoCo promo there
[13:38] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; nice
[13:38] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes
[13:39] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok lets move on to the next topic
[13:39] &lt;mapreri&gt; i kind of envision just mailing all locos and ask you "do you exist?  what's your name?  what are you doing lately?"
[13:39] &lt;mapreri&gt; and from there invite them for a chat in that call maybe.
[13:39] &lt;youngbin&gt; mapreri: yup that would be also something we can try
[13:40] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I don't think it would be a good fit for a stream, but a private call yes
[13:40] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; with the LoCo Leaders
[13:40] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 kind of reminds me of the developer advisory team in 2013
[13:40] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; kind of an office hour for the LoCo Leaders
[13:41] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Exactly
[13:41] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I like it because it will be complementary to the survey, we can include ont he survey a question regarding the usefullness and schedule for such thing
[13:42] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; anything else?
[13:42] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; That's what the developer advisory team was doing with the developers in the community back in 2012 reach out, survey, office hour and summary
[13:43] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; as it appears there's nothing else on the topic
[13:43] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; lets move on to the next
[13:43] &lt;youngbin&gt; yups we can move on
[13:43] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic Identification of additional LoCo support structures
[13:43] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so what I mean about this
[13:44] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; is something like the Ubuntu Europe Federation
[13:44] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; which is an association of European Ubuntu LoCo's
[13:44] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; that tries to help Ubuntu LoCo's in similar ways to the LoCo Council, but also, by being a legal represation to sign contracts and such
[13:45] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1
[13:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; some of the LoCo's are already associations
[13:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; most are not
[13:45] &lt;youngbin&gt; so kind of fiscal host and legal partner for locos?
[13:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; yes
[13:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; this is what the Ubuntu Europe Federation does
[13:45] &lt;youngbin&gt; would need some more discussion. but agree that it would be useful :)
[13:46] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; it's facilitated by the legal interoperabilidaty in Europe
[13:46] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Need one for India too looking at the challenges of Ubucon Asia
[13:46] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; coolbhavi: is the Free Software Foundation India not a thing?
[13:46] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; maybe they would be willing
[13:47] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; https://fsf.org.in/
[13:47] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes but they have their own challenges
[13:47] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Even SFI
[13:47] &lt;youngbin&gt; I remember India LoCo actually using FOSSUnited for UbuCon Asia but seems like it has some limitation due to regulation.
[13:47] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes
[13:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so there's nothing like Ubuntu Europe elsewhere...
[13:49] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; None that I am aware of
[13:49] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I can see how the EU makes it easier
[13:49] &lt;mapreri&gt; indeed
[13:49] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; well let's keep this in mind, and if ideas on how to overcome this come, take note and mention them on the meetings
[13:49] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes being a permanent resident in the EU I can see a lot of advantages
[13:49] &lt;mapreri&gt; remember that many countries have plenty of capital controls in place that makes moving money in/out of them annoying, so something similar to Ubuntu EU is hard to recreate cross-countries in other areas of the world.
[13:50] &lt;youngbin&gt; I agree with the idea basically. but some loco might have some limitation with access due to local regulation.
[13:50] &lt;youngbin&gt; agreed with mapreri
[13:50] &lt;youngbin&gt; maybe we can do some research first?
[13:50] &lt;mapreri&gt; or not recognizing particular entities from other countries (when talking about signing stuff, etc)
[13:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; youngbin: we should
[13:50] &lt;mapreri&gt; but for EU, that's great and useful once it running full steam indeed!
[13:51] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 there is a ton of difference I can see and we should do some research
[13:51] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; in the EU it exits, but it's not operational in practice
[13:51] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; From the eu to India I have experience
[13:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok lets research and come back to it when we have something
[13:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; next topic:
[13:52] &lt;youngbin&gt; sounds good
[13:52] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; I am interested
[13:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic LoCo outreach
[13:53] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we have already talked about it a bit, but is there something you want to add?
[13:53] &lt;youngbin&gt; well i added this topic but seems like we have already discussed on previous topics
[13:53] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Lets start with survey for the outreach and take it step by step
[13:53] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok
[13:54] &lt;mapreri&gt; yep
[13:54] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so now it's time for coolbhavi to report on the Indian Loco?
[13:54] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes.. we are hosting ubucon Asia this year in Jaipur India
[13:54] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic coolbhavi to report on the Indian Loco
[13:55] &lt;youngbin&gt; so seems like it's part of AOB :)
[13:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; how's that comming along?
[13:55] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; And the team is working on negotiating the venue now
[13:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; is there something we can do to help?
[13:55] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; This years ubucon Asia is on aug 31 to September 2
[13:56] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; now, or something you predict for the next few months?
[13:56] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Will reach out incase help is required in the coming months
[13:57] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok
[13:57] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Right now we are working on logistics and it has its own challenges in the regulations in India
[13:57] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; is there something that surprised you?
[13:58] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; maybe it will surprise any other Ubucon organizer elsewhere
[13:58] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Actually we planned for a joint event with gnome asia and that is also under discussion
[13:58] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; nice
[13:59] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; No surprises till now as we expected challenges due to regulations
[13:59] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; And we are working around it
[13:59] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I and a few people from Debian are planning to try DebConf 26 in Portugal, and if we can we also try Ubucon Europe here the days before
[14:00] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Only surprise is the venue asking for 50 percent of ticket sales as venue fees
[14:00] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; So we are negotiating
[14:00] &lt;youngbin&gt; coolbhavi: many thanks for the work :) looking forward to see UbuCon Asia happening in Jaipur
[14:00] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; yes
[14:01] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; keep it up
[14:01] &lt;youngbin&gt; coolbhavi: So the fee rate is depending on ticket pricing?
[14:01] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Welcome and yes we are excited too
[14:01] &lt;youngbin&gt; i think i will be also busy with organizing events: UbuCon Asia, UbuCon KR, DebConf24 so many lol
[14:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; yes
[14:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; those are a lot
[14:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I have less
[14:02] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; youngbin: they are not bothered about the fee rate they need 50 percent of whatever ticket sales
[14:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; UbunCon Portugal which will be during the Free Software Festival, and I'm part of the orga for both
[14:02] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Which I have a meeting on Monday
[14:02] &lt;youngbin&gt; :+1
[14:03] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; As exams are still going on in parts of the country
[14:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; coolbhavi: ticket 0$, just ask for donations :P
[14:03] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ;P
[14:03] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; That's my worst case scenario
[14:04] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Haha
[14:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we only charged for the first Ubucon Europe
[14:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; but we got meals for free
[14:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; in return
[14:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; all others where gratis
[14:05] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Hmm good point will negotiate and come up with more details next meeting
[14:05] &lt;mapreri&gt; personally I'll need to go in ~15 mins, FYI
[14:05] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I also
[14:05] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so lets end here
[14:05] &lt;youngbin&gt; same
[14:05] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Same here
[14:05] &lt;youngbin&gt; next meeting and chair?
[14:05] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; let's do the next one on the 8th of March?
[14:05] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; I am fine
[14:06] &lt;youngbin&gt; sure
[14:06]  * mapreri checking
[14:06] &lt;mapreri&gt; March 8th looks good to me yep
[14:06] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok I'll check with Kanashiro
[14:06] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; if it's ok with him we can announce it

[14:08] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; who wants do to it next?
[14:08] &lt;mapreri&gt; could somebody go through the current meeting, and figure out some action points? :puppy_eyes:  just share them on telegram i guess
[14:08] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; mapreri: I'll report on it on the topic
[14:08] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; but will confirm with you all before
[14:08] &lt;mapreri&gt; I could possibly chair irc meetings if nobody raise their hands by meeting time.
[14:09] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok
[14:09] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; thank you all
[14:09] &lt;youngbin&gt; You can create meeting report topic. And we can reuse agenda post for next meeting (it's a wiki post)
[14:09] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; will try that
[14:09] &lt;youngbin&gt; ð
[14:09] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Thanks everyone

[16:05] &lt;schopin&gt; it's fairly standard: retry all failing tests, both with and without glibc, and then do it again because of a hiccup or another :)

[16:13] &lt;bdmurray&gt; You were voluntold
[16:13] &lt;adrien_&gt; you know this meeting schedule is not convenient for me already :)
[16:14] &lt;ravikant_&gt; shouldn't have raised you hand
[16:14] &lt;juliank&gt; The apport one should be easy, and needs doing
[16:14] &lt;juliank&gt; I'll go tag it
[16:14] &lt;ravikant_&gt; I think doko volunteered already

[16:21] &lt;juliank&gt; So uh no volunteers?
[16:21] &lt;ravikant_&gt; alright, I'll try. julianl, let me know if I miss something.
[16:21] &lt;juliank&gt; ok!
[16:21] &lt;_doko&gt; I'll comment on the python3-defaults ones, but didn't prepare for anything else
[16:22] &lt;ravikant_&gt; lets start with python3-defaults?
[16:23] &lt;dbungert&gt; &gt; update-motd (- to 3.10) in proposed for 686 days - is that a bug in the report?
[16:23] &lt;_doko&gt; no, that's a demotion from release to proposed

[16:24] &lt;_doko&gt; ?
[16:24] &lt;_doko&gt; includes python-mitogen

[16:25] &lt;_doko&gt; apport ?
[16:25] &lt;schopin&gt; I guess I'm the best placed to take that on too while bdrung is away
[16:25] &lt;_doko&gt; any volunteers?
[16:25] &lt;_doko&gt; ok
[16:26] &lt;_doko&gt; apprise: ? there is some debian bug / activity now

[02:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; Juest: publishing your keys should be pretty safe, at least if you want the email address on the keys to be published..
[02:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; Juest: consuming keys from the keyservers is riskier, but still moderately safe
[13:42] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: just gonna ask but since when has Microsoft ever done anything to the standards expected for software specs and stuff (re: unzip bug)
[13:43] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; teward: hehe, well, you'd think they would do interoperability tests...but I guess not :)
[13:44] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: I mean Microsoft **intentionally** ignores/violates email RFC for handling responding to messages, prioritizing the 'Thread-Topic' header - a microsoft-ism - over 'Subject' when hitting "Reply" in any Microsoft mail client
[13:45] &lt;teward&gt; and breaks things like lists, etc.
=== sdeziel_ is now known as sdeziel
[13:45] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; teward: it took me _way_ too long to figure out why I couldn't extract a downloaded pictures zip file
[13:45] &lt;teward&gt; Microsoft has *zero* care for standards and they've proved it time and time again
[13:45] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: welcome to Microsoft, population "Use our [CENSORED] and nothing else"
[13:45] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; teward: breathe in, breathe out
[13:46] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: oh i haven't even BEGUN my daily microsoft hatred tirade!  *ground shakes and shatters and dark smoke and fire just erupt from the hellhole that opened*
[13:46] &lt;teward&gt; :P
[13:46] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: but no Microsoft has never cared for interop with anything.  Except basic WSL stuff
[13:47] &lt;teward&gt; and... well, that's about it.  Only thing they did positive was SQL Server for Linux when you *need* MS SQL Server and PSQL isn't a good alternative
[13:47] &lt;teward&gt; ye i'm biased :P
[13:58] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; hehehe
[14:19] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: security related question, how much of a 'security' bug is it when the default permissions set by the installer 
[14:19] &lt;teward&gt; for a netplan yml on install trigger immediate warnings from Netplan when applying?
[14:19] &lt;teward&gt; blah stupid keyboard
[14:19] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; teward: you mean the permissions are too open?
[14:20] &lt;teward&gt; encountered last night on a brand new 22.04 image with up to date netplan, the 50-cloud-config.yml file was created with 644 root:root perms and Netplan started whining about 'too open' and wouldn't stop yelling unless it was 600
[14:20] &lt;teward&gt; ye
[14:20] &lt;teward&gt; trying to reproduce in a 22.04 VM because LXD containers sometimes are not the most reliable test
[14:20] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; well, file a bug, but since it's the installer, there's no real point in it going to -security
[14:21] &lt;teward&gt; right that'd be against subiquity or whatever it is in use right now
[14:21] &lt;teward&gt; was wondering if it qualified as a security bug or not though
[14:21] &lt;teward&gt; just before i go down the rabbit hole :P
[14:24] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; sure, it's complaining for a reason, mark it security
=== chris14_ is now known as chris14
[21:36] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: for awareness, https://bugs.launchpad.net/subiquity/+bug/2052524 was filed for that issue i observed.  The backport of netplan.io to jammy-updates introduced the new warnings unlike previous, and Foundations has this on their todo list to address for the installer now I believe

[15:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that is almost a year old
[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; But other than a bit more info on testing
[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; which now that it is meant to be used might be easier
[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this ought to be ready

[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: I think you might want to ping internally that this might be soon promoted?
[15:34] &lt;slyon&gt; yes, I'll double-check this
[15:34] &lt;sarnold&gt; good morning
[15:35] &lt;eslerm&gt; hi Seth o/
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I updated the bug slyon
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this looks easy to be fully completed
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; in proposed we have more
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but mostly old usual suspects
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; mirespace: will you let us know when libcryptx-perl is ready for now (without the algorithm that is badly implemented)?
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; if anyone here is curious, we found a compromise how to go on with https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libcryptx-perl/+bug/2046154
[15:36] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2046154 in libcryptx-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libcryptx-perl (libmail-dkim-perl dependency)" [Undecided, New]
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; TL;DR get is completed (the whole stack) with all, except ed25519
[15:36] &lt;mirespace&gt; yes, I will do ... not touched since the steps sgreement, sorry
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; go for a ed25519 implementation as wrapper around the supported openssl
[15:37] &lt;mirespace&gt; yes
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and then add that to Ubuntu
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; next new in mismatches is "designate"
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; wantin python-edgegrid and ndg-httpsclient
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; never heard of this
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm sure this will haunt me and it is a server package ...
[15:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; oh no, it is openstack
[15:38] &lt;eslerm&gt; (I'm behind in comments in the bug for libcryptx-perl, apologize, discussion looks good)
[15:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks eslerm
[15:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; jamespage: I assume you need to pick this up later designate -&gt; python-edgegrid and ndg-httpsclient will need to be looked at

[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; wow
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; there are 5 new in there
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; cryptx goes back to mirespace until this change has happend
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'll update the bug
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; The rest are things we knew are coming
[15:40] &lt;slyon&gt; so I could probably take wsl-pro-service, as the others are from foundations
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah
[15:40] &lt;joalif&gt; I could take trace-cmd
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks assigned
[15:41] &lt;joalif&gt; but no promises it'll be ready by next week, I'm already working on another 2 mirs
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; fair
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'll take libtracefs
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and as usual didrocks is fine to get one scheduled (at least that was the deal so far)
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; which I'll do with libtraceevent
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; TBH I'm also not yet entirely sure when I'll get to mine
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; surely not before Friday and even then ...
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but we now have one each
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and the list is drained
[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; \o/
[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; BTW trace-cmd and related are part of the many MIRs to be expected that I mentioned last week
[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; around debug/perf tooling to be available more easily
[15:43] &lt;slyon&gt; yes, there are more in the works at foundations

[15:46] &lt;eslerm&gt; for apparmor profiles, we oculd put this off until after 24.04
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this has been discussed in the past
[15:46] &lt;eslerm&gt; an apparmor profile will be required for authd
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it was a "would be nice, but sometimes is impossibly hard" case
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; just like some others we had
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm +1 on having such a rule
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; after all we keep having "add profiles" items every cycle
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; to get things added in the past isolated
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'd ask for some "not too easy, but there is a way out" kind of wording
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; if you happen to be providing the 1245676th package of the gnome stack
[15:48] &lt;eslerm&gt; recently, the apparmor team has begun needing to write profiles (there is a new mandate) and it would be nice if owning or development teams owned that
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; then you can't be expected to be the one that makes all gnome isolated
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; for example
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I've seen the updates on jira about adding apparmor
[15:48] &lt;eslerm&gt; that type of wording works
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and I smiled as - like I said - we do that almost every cycle for a while
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but we had cases where you just can not predict the millions of ways something is used
[15:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; so very true
[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; I believe apparmor folks would be responsible to review, it would be reasonable
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; with a wording that is not too allowing but leaving a door open I'm ok
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; will you or the apparmor folks provide a PR on how they think
[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; can do
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we can then discuss until we reach a wording we believe that works
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and the first few passing that will then tell us how possible or impossible that is
[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; I wanted to start the discussion, and work on this mostly for 24.10
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so epxect reviewing this in a while
[15:50] &lt;eslerm&gt; thank you
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ack on please not being applicable to 24.04 super late
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks for the heads up
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; section wise we are in security
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I see the training of people worked
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; plenty of new faces assigned in the in-progress column
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; a few TODO, but nothing in the far backlog
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; umm
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: about SEC-2671
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the LP item went to Won't Fix
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and sarnold ^^
[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the dependency tree has been changed, this won't be needed
[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; should it be removed from the security board as well?
[15:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; nice :)
[15:52] &lt;eslerm&gt; thanks for catching that, I'll move them
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic Any other business?
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; nothing in addition to the above from me
[15:53] &lt;slyon&gt; nothing

[16:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; Sure, thanks

[16:02] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 16:02:25 UTC.  The chair is utkarsh2102.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

[16:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; nothing on agenda, moving straight to AOB
[16:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #topic AOB
[16:03] &lt;sil2100&gt; I'd like to use to occassion to apologize for missing out so many DMB meetings recently
[16:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; we do not accept apologies, only beer
[16:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; or whiskey, for some people ;)
[16:04] &lt;sil2100&gt; Especially apologize to all the applicants that had their applications handled while I was away
[16:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; hey! CPC has a packageset (ubuntu-cloud; cf: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/packagesets/noble/ubuntu-cloud). We'd like to revive it and the first step would be to polish it a bit. Would it be okay to drop some packages from the package and add some new via the usual process (mail devel-permissions@ with the updated list and collect
[16:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; +1s, et al). Would anyone have an objection?
[16:05] &lt;sil2100&gt; I don't see why not, we can vote on the actual packageset changes via ML as usual
[16:05] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I don't think it is necessary to review removals.
[16:05] &lt;rbasak&gt; As long as the changes match the defined packageset description "Packages required to create, bootstrap, use or configure Ubuntu Cloud images and their derivatives" then we only require one DMB member to approve.
[16:05] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Only additions.
[16:05] &lt;rbasak&gt; Though please keep the record on the ML
[16:06] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; of course
[16:07] &lt;bdmurray&gt; o/ one topic
[16:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; perfect, since there are no objections, I'll come back with the new set in some time on the list.
[16:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; yes, please
[16:07] &lt;bdmurray&gt; me?
[16:08] &lt;bdmurray&gt; We need to run an election in the next couple of months. When do we need to start working on that?
[16:09] &lt;bdmurray&gt; 3 memberships in the board expire on 2024-03-29.
[16:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; Ah - thank you for noticing!
[16:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; More in June also
[16:09] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; yes
[16:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; I have a schedule somewhere
[16:09] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; 3 in March and 4 in June :P
[16:09] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; the whole board essentially
[16:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-dev/+git/election-tools/tree/README.DMB#n49
[16:10] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; it's a 1-month process, we should start mid Feb, at least
[16:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; I cleaned up and documented the whole process over the past couple of elections.
[16:10] &lt;bdmurray&gt; In the release team we use Day -28
[16:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; bdmurray: feel free to adjust :)
[16:11] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Obviously, I think that's a bit easier to read.
[16:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; I guess maybe this way round makes more sense actually, as typically the election gets delayed so the variable end as at that end of the schedule, as opposed to Ubuntu releases where the release date typically doesn't change.
[16:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm happy to run the election again unless someone else wants to do it?
[16:12] &lt;bdmurray&gt; The release date certianly *shoulndn't* change.
[16:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; Technically it's run by the TB, but usually delegated to someone who doesn't necessarily have to be on the TB.
[16:12] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; rbasak: is it a lot of work? if not, I'd like to run once, just to see how it is :)
[16:13] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Should somebody who might be running for a position conduct the election?
[16:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; utkarsh2102: up to you to decide - it's documented :)
[16:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; bdmurray: that question comes up every time but practically we don't usually have any other choice.
[16:13] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; coolio, i'll let you know in the next meeting then o/
[16:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; bdmurray: I have no reason to distrust any of the people who might end up running it this time.
[16:14] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bdmurray: I, for one, wouldn't be running for the position so that should be squared away
[16:14] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; in case I run :)
[16:14] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I don't think its about our trust but the voters trust.
[16:14] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; in case I run =&gt; in case I conduct the elections
[16:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; I don't think this is a productive thread of conversation unless we actually have someone meeting that criterion volunteering.
[16:15] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Bazinga! Agreed though
[16:16] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; perfect, anything else, anyone?
[16:17] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; tick tick 3
[16:17] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; tick tick 2

[16:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; Uh
[16:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; Were we going to conclude what we're going to do about the election?
[16:18] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; rbasak: did we not discuss that?
[16:18] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Utkarsh will review the tasks and decide in two weeks if he can take it on.
[16:18] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; that $someone will run it; I'll let you know by the next meeting if I will otherwise you can :)
[16:18] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; yep, that^
[16:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK thanks

[00:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; Juest: "safe to use", well, that's a good question. the security model of openpgp is based around validating the signatures on keys and building a chain of trust, etc
[00:54] &lt;sarnold&gt; Juest: but most people weren't using the SKS keyservers that way, and when those were bombarded with junk signatures that would DOS gpg, evyerone sort of realized that we're asking more of the keyservers than we thought we were
[00:54] &lt;Juest&gt; i see
[00:55] &lt;sarnold&gt; Juest: the keyserver.ubuntu.com keyservers are definitely intended for public use, we host them so that the FOSS communities can use them, and communicate better with each other
[00:55] &lt;sarnold&gt; Juest: obviously, if they wind up being abused by a handful of users, our IS folks might put protections in place to prevent the abuse, but standard end user things is just fine
[01:15] &lt;Juest&gt; thank you sarnold 
[01:15] &lt;sarnold&gt; sure thing Juest :) have fun :)

[00:10] &lt;sarnold&gt; rbasak, schopin, teward, my understanding is that this google-guest-agent fix is especially important to get in via security ESM -- that way, unattended-upgrades will install it, and then the affected users will be able to log in to their machines again
[13:46] &lt;Habbie&gt; looks like mailman on security-announce let something through

[22:10] &lt;Juest&gt; hello, is keyserver.ubuntu.com safe to use? why it has been adopted by a lot of apps including gnupg? was it intended to be a public service unlike the debian one which is reserved for packages?
[22:10] &lt;Juest&gt; pardon for the questions, i prefer chat

[16:05] &lt;upils&gt; I added some labels on it to make sure my jobs runs on them and not the shared runners. And I need to find who is managing them to understand how they are setup to compare with shared ones (because spread is missing on the shared ones)
[16:05] &lt;Skia&gt; o/
[16:05]  * vorlon waves
[16:06] &lt;upils&gt; and shared ones are used if the repo ones are already working, so sometimes, the job end up on a shared ones, missing spread

[16:18] &lt;juliank&gt; I'll tag all of them
[16:18] &lt;juliank&gt; When do we move ubiquity to universe?
[16:18] &lt;vorlon&gt; when oem-config is split out of the source
[16:19] &lt;vorlon&gt; because we can't rely on the Ubuntu Desktop team's new first boot wizard meeting the needs of the raspi images in time for noble

[16:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; you don't get usrmerge back :)
[16:20] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Is moving ubiquity to universe a priority such that that the team should do what vorlon says?
[16:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; yes
[16:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; flavors that are staying on ubiquity should have direct commit/upload control without being gated by Core Dev or Foundations
[16:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; and we should do the work for the one-time split, instead of the ongoing work of having to sponsor uploads :)

[16:27] &lt;juliank&gt; yes
[16:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; so

[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; uh hang on update_excuses shows libxcrypt blocked by a lot more stuff than what's listed on the by-team report
[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; um just punt on this
[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; because I can't trust the report
[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; sorry

[16:29] &lt;juliank&gt; :)
[16:30] &lt;adrien&gt; or at least look at why it shows up
[16:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; adrien: my point is the card already says it's done and there's still a failing autopkgtest on armhf
[16:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; (from today)
[16:30] &lt;juliank&gt; adrien: these all failed https://autopkgtest.ubuntu.com/packages/r/ruby3.1/noble/armhf

[16:30] &lt;schopin&gt; poor adrien cannot escape armhf
[16:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; libdbi-perl vs mariadb: cpete please
[16:30] &lt;cpete&gt; ack
[16:31] &lt;adrien&gt; juliank: not updated yet (armhf tests are still running)
[16:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; libfilesys-df-perl vs sbuild: I'll take this because I already have the horrible commandline here to set the almost-complete set of extra triggers
[16:31] &lt;adrien&gt; vorlon: ah, ok, it's just a matter of waiting for tests
[16:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; adrien: ok
[16:31] &lt;adrien&gt; they're still queued; I could only requeue them effectively yesterday late evening I think

[16:32] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; vorlon, ack
[16:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; sorry, that's actually pyyaml in general
[16:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; (llvm-toolchain-14 has 4 packages w/ failing autopkgtests to sort)
[16:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-apt: juliank resolved the ftbfs from last week, now it's blocked on u-r-u autopkgtests. juliank do you want this again this week?
[16:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; or do you want someone else to look at u-r-u
[16:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; openssl i386 autopkgtest regression blocking perl, sounds like a me (generally, archive admin) thing to sort out; I'll take
[16:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; click autopkgtest blocking perl: waveform please
[16:34] &lt;waveform&gt; ack
[16:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; sbuild/s390x blocking perl: dviererbe please

[16:35] &lt;juliank&gt; vorlon: I'm doing u-r-u that's why I also took the bug
[16:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; waveform: psmisc vs systemd
[16:35] &lt;waveform&gt; okay
[16:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: ok

[16:36] &lt;Skia&gt; vorlon: ack
[16:36] &lt;xypron&gt; ok
[16:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; llvm-toolchain-14 on arm64 also blocks ncurses, so danilogondolfo please take this also

[16:37] &lt;mkukri&gt; vorlon: ack
[16:38] &lt;vorlon&gt; that takes us to python3-defaults; ginggs is there anything to say on this generally before I dole out tasks?
[16:38] &lt;ginggs&gt; err
[16:38] &lt;juliank&gt; I think some we already took as bugs
[16:38] &lt;ginggs&gt; backdoor-factory i'm testing a patch
[16:38] &lt;juliank&gt; (apport, ubiquity, u-r-u)
[16:39] &lt;ginggs&gt; datalad-next i triggered retries recently
[16:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; automake-1.16 blocking python: enr0n

[20:01] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; lucyllewy: Usually # works better. :)
[20:02] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; #startmeeting Ubuntu Membership Board
[20:02] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 20:02:26 UTC.  The chair is lucyllewy.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

[20:02] &lt;meetingology&gt; Current chairs: lucyllewy
[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; Hello and welcome to the Ubuntu Membership Review Board meeting for 1st February 2024. The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards
[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.
[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).
[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.
[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.
[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)
[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...
[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; We only have one applicant today, Jason Nucciaarone
[20:04] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Hello everyone o/
[20:04] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; @nuccitheboss can you please introduce yourself to the board and share your launchpad and application links
[20:04] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Yes yes
[20:04] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; I'll share the links first and then write my bio
[20:05] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Application link: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jason-c-nucciarone-membership-application/41501/1

[20:06] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Okay - time for intro
[20:10] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; My name is Jason C. Nucciarone and I am an HPC engineer at Canonical, and a "Not so Ancient Elder" of the Ubuntu HPC community. Outside my primary duties at Canonical, I like to work with all things community. I started the HPC community team with several folks in the Ubuntu community to work on "Charmed HPC," which is a supercomputing stack that we are developing for Ubuntu. I am dedicated to this project because I want
[20:10] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; to see Ubuntu more represented in the HPC ecosystem and be a viable alternative to the RHELatives. I do all sorts of things HPC, such as working with Simon, Aaron, and Mauro to organise Ubuntu-related conference, and I submit to lots of conference to speak about using Ubuntu for supercomputing
[20:11] &lt;Kilos&gt; ty
[20:12] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; ok. I'll let the board peruse those links and post and questions with the first question, which is mandatory:
[20:12] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; You have signed the Code of Conduct. Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be granted?
[20:12] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Yes!
[20:12] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; awesome. thank you for confirming. I'll open the floor to the rest of the board to ask any questions
[20:14] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; None as testimonials speak well :D
[20:14] &lt;Kilos&gt; ditto
[20:15] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; ok. then lets move on to the voting cos I'm happy as well

[14:30] &lt;jdstrand&gt; allenpthuang: hey, thanks for the postfix update :)
[14:46] &lt;teward&gt; looks like schopin is pointing this your way, Sec Team, for updating something out-of-band (Xenial, Bionic) that isnt covered by sponsors.  
[14:46] &lt;teward&gt; https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/google-guest-agent/+bug/2050956
[14:46] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- Launchpad bug 2050956 in google-guest-agent (Ubuntu Bionic) "[SRU] Update d/control file with dependencies" [Undecided, New]
[14:47] &lt;schopin&gt; I'm honestly unsure of where I should have pointed it so please someone correct me, but I'm fairly sure this is out of the jurisdiction of mere core-devs and MOTUs :)
[15:00] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; I think leosilva is already on it
[17:10] &lt;teward&gt; schopin: i'm also pretty sure that unless it's a critical update and Security wants to update it it won't get updated.  (I've had one or two OOB uploads approved by AAs in edge cases though as a coredev)
[17:10] &lt;teward&gt; but ye it's outside the standard scope
[17:11]  * schopin actually looks at the proposed changes
[17:12] &lt;teward&gt; see this is the thing that makes me pause here
[17:12] &lt;teward&gt; "`google-guest-agent` is a package provided by Google for installation within guests that run on Google Compute Engine (GCE)"
[17:13] &lt;teward&gt; GCE shouldn't be offering those older images still
[17:13] &lt;teward&gt; if they are they're doing something odd/stupid
[17:13] &lt;teward&gt; or rather, they shouldn't offer those images for *NEW* installs IMO
[17:14] &lt;teward&gt; if they simply... disable Xenial / Bionic image selection... that kind of solves the issue already no?
[17:15] &lt;schopin&gt; I'm not much of a cloud person, are dist-upgrades not a thing in that domain?
[17:16] &lt;teward&gt; last i checked GCE behaved like AWS EC2 instances or VPSes, and can dist-upgrade.  I'm not *google* but if this package is provided **for installation within guests** and does something that enables GCE stuff in the VM environment (similar to open-vm-tools for VMware for example), then it would be part of the image on-install
[17:17] &lt;teward&gt; and if the older images are *gone* then the issue is irrelevant since new installs can't be run for those releases
[17:17] &lt;teward&gt; and anything having the image already would already have everything
[17:17] &lt;teward&gt; my 2 cents and cursory untested unvetted thoughts
[17:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not familiar with their offering but I am aware that you can get instances from cloud vendors that have Ubuntu Pro included, and therefore I infer that it makes sense for cloud vendors to continue offering those instance types until EOL.
[17:17] &lt;teward&gt; rbasak: by EOL do you mean Pro EOL or overall EOL/
[17:18] &lt;teward&gt; and in which case if Pro is enabled shouldn't this be distributed via ESM / Pro and not standard SRU
[17:18] &lt;rbasak&gt; End of Standard Support = 5 years; End of Life = 10 years or whatever Pro ends up being by then.
[17:18] &lt;schopin&gt; Well yes, that's why I directed them to Security (because in my mind Pro updates -&gt; Security)
[17:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not sure if the agent needs to be special via SRU. We do push the Pro Client via SRU as an exception (details and rationale documented at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuAdvantageToolsUpdates)
[17:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; Looking at the bug, sounds like the plan is to put it in via ESM, and it's just a matter of managing the bug tasks appropriately?

[15:42] &lt;sarnold&gt; we've got five MIRs in-flight at the moment, three with new reviewers :) things are feeling good
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; nice that you get those new reviewers started as planned
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; looking good indeed
[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic Any other business?
[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I have a heads up for MIR and security team
[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; anyone else before I go into details?
[15:43] &lt;sarnold&gt; I don't think so...
[15:43] &lt;slyon&gt; no
[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, then here the FYI
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; there is effort in making the default set of tools available for performance and crash analysis nicer to the users
[15:44] &lt;sarnold&gt; nice
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; details vary and depend on the context, no need to go into too much details - if you are curious get in touch
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but what is worth
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; is that out of that effort there will be an expected flurry of MIRs and associated security reviews coming
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the amount is probably 3-8
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so not too insane
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but it will be noble time-frame
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so to whatever amount you can, reserve some time and tell your managers upfront
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; involved are mostly kernel, foundations and server - but to some extend anyone that feels to belong to *ubuntu*
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so much for now I'd think
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think the MIR review capactity is fine for this
[15:46] &lt;eslerm&gt; knowning which packages to plan for would help
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; for security we thought this is worth to be mentioned to know about it by now instead of out of a sudden
[15:46] &lt;eslerm&gt; it is appreciated :)
[15:47] &lt;sarnold&gt; in yesterday's team meeting I communicated that there's usually a flurry of last-minute packages to review
[15:47] &lt;sarnold&gt; so hopefully our need for more reviewers won't come as a surprise
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: sarnold: For details you can go to FO147 spec for now and anything you find linked from jira Fr-6202
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; with that being said, I think we are good for now
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; any other famous last words?
[15:48] &lt;sarnold&gt; have a nice day?
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, that is a now
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; no
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; see you all

[20:01] &lt;sil2100&gt; Apologies everyone, I won't be able to actively participate in today's meeting. I'm fighting quite a headache and I'm afraid I'll be useless today
[20:01] &lt;vorlon&gt; sil2100: rest well
[20:01] &lt;seb128&gt; hey
[20:01] &lt;vorlon&gt; #startmeeting
[20:01] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 20:01:50 UTC.  The chair is vorlon.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology
[20:01] &lt;meetingology&gt; Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick
[20:01] &lt;vorlon&gt; [topic] Apologies
[20:02] &lt;vorlon&gt; sil2100 in real time let us know he won't be attending today
[20:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; The agenda looks quiet today, but I think there are some flavour LTS qualifications outstanding from the ML, and also I'd like to discuss my "onsensus on question of test plans for third party apps" action item if we have time.
[20:02] &lt;vorlon&gt; and it looks like we have everyone else here?
[20:03] &lt;vorlon&gt; #topic Action review
[20:03] &lt;vorlon&gt; there are a lot of actions listed; rather than going point-by-point, can I just ask if anyone has updates, and assume the rest are carry-over? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoardAgenda
[20:04] &lt;rbasak&gt; All mine are to carry over please. Though as above I've been looking at one, might as well carry it over until discussed since it's unlikely to be resolved completely today.
[20:04] &lt;amurray&gt; sounds good to me (mine are all carry-over)
[20:04] &lt;seb128&gt; ACTION: seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu cinnamon on 24.04 request  -&gt; https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002853.html
[20:04] &lt;seb128&gt; no reply from them though
[20:04] &lt;seb128&gt; ACTION: seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu budgie on 24.04 request  -&gt; https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002855.html
[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: thanks
[20:05] &lt;seb128&gt; and we had 4 +1 votes so I think that's approved
[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; agreed
[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; mine is also carry-over
[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: do you want to send a follow-up email to confirm this is approved?
[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; (amurray had an action to do so for UbuntuKylin)
[20:06] &lt;amurray&gt; yeah not sure how I missed that but will get to it later today
[20:06] &lt;seb128&gt; vorlon, yes, I will send the budgie email
[20:07] &lt;vorlon&gt; #action seb128 to send confirmation of successful LTS status for UbuntuBudgie 24.04
[20:07] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: seb128 to send confirmation of successful LTS status for UbuntuBudgie 24.04
[20:07] &lt;vorlon&gt; #topic Scan the mailing list archive for anything we missed (standing item)
[20:07] &lt;vorlon&gt; the various vote threads are accounted for, I think
[20:07] &lt;vorlon&gt; two other threads on there we should probably touch base on
[20:08] &lt;vorlon&gt; first is "VirtualBox Postmortem"
[20:08] &lt;vorlon&gt; tsimonq2 let me know he wasn't available to attend this meeting today
[20:08] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I'm here in his absence.
[20:08] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (I did a bunch of the VirtualBox testing to solve the bug that email is related to.)
[20:09] &lt;vorlon&gt; I have lots of thoughts in regards to that email, but perhaps someone who's not wearing dual TB + SRU hats wants to comment first
[20:09] &lt;vorlon&gt; (which would be seb128 or amurray rather than rbasak or myself)
[20:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; I do wear both hats, but my usual response in these cases is to ask for the responsible team to respond in the first instance.
[20:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; In other words, even when TB escalation is appropriate, the TB should seek to get input from both sides - from both the complainant(s) and the responsible teams. In this case that'd be the SRU team, rather than non-SRU team members.
[20:11] &lt;seb128&gt; right, I'm unsure if that's a topic for the TB at this point, I would like at least to see a reply from the SRU team first
[20:11] &lt;vorlon&gt; well I'm going to say that the reason I haven't responded to this email at all yet is that I found it to be an entirely unconstructive and anti-collaborative approach to the question
[20:11] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, vorlon, do you have any insight if the SRU team is working on a reply?
[20:11] &lt;amurray&gt; from my point of view, whilst I can entirely understand the frustrations expressed in the email, I also can sympathise with the SRU team et al - due to the distributed / silo'd nature of Ubuntu development this kind of thing feels sometimes inevitable even when we try hard to coordinate to avoid such situations
[20:12] &lt;amurray&gt; so unless a response from the SRU team highlights any particular problems on their side, I am not sure there is much for the TB to do at this time
[20:12] &lt;vorlon&gt; I'm not aware of a current SRU team decision about responding to the email
[20:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; The SRU team haven't had an opportunity to discuss this yet really.
[20:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; The relevant people to discuss this are in a late-ish timezone, and we usually chat every four weeks, and that hasn't come up yet.
[20:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; I don't mind going into more details now, on behalf of the SRU team, and while vorlon's also here. But maybe that's not really appropriate right now (or do others think otherwise?)
[20:14] &lt;seb128&gt; is that going to happen before the next TB meeting then? if so maybe let's revisit next time?
[20:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; It might be if we were in a rush, but I have noticed SRU activity on this package, so is there still a rush?
[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; should happen this week I think?
[20:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; Yes - on Thursday - assuming the other relevant people are able to attend.
[20:14] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; February 2, the new VBox SRU should be ready to go out. Me and LoB already did all verificaiton.
[20:15] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; So I can confirm this week.
[20:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; yes, SRU team meeting Thursday
[20:15] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (assuming the SRU team does migrations from -proposed to -updates on Friday - I don't actually know if this is the case)
[20:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'd like to be constructive here, but I'm finding that quite challenging.
[20:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; A couple of things to note, if you're expecting the release to happen because you've marked verification-done...
[20:16] &lt;seb128&gt; that's a long email with a lot of details, but to me it seems the SRU team should maybe add to their process to check if a kernel update breaks virtualbox
[20:17] &lt;vorlon&gt; yes, a "post mortem" which assumes itself to be in possession of all of the facts without consulting &gt; half the people involved, and drawing conclusions and assigning blame, is not a springboard for a constructive discussion
[20:17] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: that's the thing, I haven't had time to dig into this, but kernel SRUs are supposed to check the results of all dkms package builds
[20:17] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I think with the virtualbox breakage bug, the issue was that the update was never accepted into proposed in the first place. There was nothing any other team could have done.
[20:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#virtualbox is false. Contrary to what that says, I don't consider anything pre-approved by the SRU. I've mentioned this on IRC to LocutusOfBorg before.
[20:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; by the SRU team
[20:18] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I didn't read Simon's email as attempting to be a be-all-end-all postmortem, I thought it was intended to start discussion, laying out everything Simon knew already. His tone is rather negative, but I think he was trying to be constructive and that he had some good points if you read past the tone.
[20:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; From what I consider to be the draft at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VirtualboxUpdates, it's not clear to me what precisely is committed to being verified, and even if it were, that hasn't been agreed by the SRU team. Therefore, there isn't a standard for me to confirm against that appopriate verification has been performed.
[20:19] &lt;vorlon&gt; arraybolt3: telling the SRU team "you owe N an apology" is a pretty hard tone to get past.
[20:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; In bug 2050891, currently the Test Plan says: "Install virtualbox, run VMs". That is not an acceptable test plan IMHO.
[20:19] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Valid, I just am saying, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
[20:19] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2050891 in virtualbox-hwe (Ubuntu Mantic) "[SRU] virtualbox 6.1.50 and 7.0.14" [Undecided, Fix Committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2050891
[20:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; I believe this has all been raised before, and not addressed.
[20:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; So from my perspective, were I asked to release it, the SRU is blocked.
[20:20] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; rbasak: I think LocutusOfBorg simply put the test plan in the wrong spot.
[20:20] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; To be fair, LoB told people in private chats that he was feeling ignored and got tired of pinging in #ubuntu-release since October that an SRU of virtualbox was ready for review. So, this was not a failure on his part.
[20:20] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; It's right under "Where Problems Could Occur" under the "Some Guest OSes might fail to load" part.
[20:21] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; Literally broke his spirit. That's no way to treat a community member.
[20:21] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I can fix that right now if it's needed to unblock the SRU.
[20:21] &lt;rbasak&gt; My frustration is that we iterated enough times already and it's still not acceptable to me. When I've been asked, I've tried to be helpful. I believe that conversation has already been linked to.
[20:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let's be constructive please.
[20:23] &lt;seb128&gt; I didn't found the detail by reading through the email again, but did anyone attempted to block promotion to updates of the kernel by flagging that it created a regression?
[20:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; I hope it's quite clear that currently expectations are far from being met, and that this is the root cause of the issue.
[20:23] &lt;seb128&gt; if not why did people do IRC pings instead of following the process?
[20:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; So let's try to figure out how to get to a place where they are met, rather than throw accusations around.
[20:23] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; seb128: tsimonq2 pinged xnox .
[20:23] &lt;seb128&gt; xnox isn't an SRU team member
[20:24] &lt;seb128&gt; and that wouldn't flag the SRU as not to promote on the SRU report
[20:24] &lt;seb128&gt; anyway, I don't think we will resolve that tonight
[20:24] &lt;seb128&gt; I would suggest we wait for the SRU team meeting this week and to see if there is an outcome of that discussion
[20:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; true, but I think it's useful to have this frank discussion about some of the issues here, that as I mentioned was a bit blocked on the lists because long-form emails are something of a barrier
[20:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; From my perspective, if someone says something is ready for review, I ask for substantial changes, they don't fix what I requested and then say it's ready for review again, so I ask for substantial changes, ad infinitum, at what point is it no longer reasonable to claim that I'm treating the uploader badly?
[20:25] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; Another point: The SRU team meets *every four weeks?* Is this a time constraint issue, because, as someone with a leadership degree, this is not how teams are run under any circumstance. Furthermore, does the SRU team meet *behind closed doors*? That seems pretty suspicious to me.
[20:26] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I'm fairly certain there's an SRU team meeting in this channel every four weeks?
[20:26] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; rbasak: "I believe that conversation has already been linked to." I may be blind, but I don't see the link. (I'd just like to look over it so I can get a better understanding.)
[20:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; I reject the characterization of this as "suspicious".  The SRU team is not a "leadership" team, it is a functional team with work to do and the meetings are internal to the team for getting things done
[20:27] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; vorlon: A community team though, with community governance? I reject the notion that an open source team should be behind closed doors.
[20:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; expecting teams to not have private meetings for working through outstanding task lists is unhelpful
[20:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; I categorically reject this framing
[20:28] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; I categorically disagree.
[20:28] &lt;rbasak&gt; arraybolt3: it's in tsimonq2's email
[20:28] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I'll have to agree with vorlon. We have a private Matrix Operators meeting every week in order to discuss difficult technical and management topics, we're an open-source and community-related team, and this is what is working best for us so far.
[20:28] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; rbasak: thanks, I am blind then :P
[20:29] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; arraybolt3: However, an SRU team isn't a team that has to deal with private matters regarding individuals.
[20:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; arraybolt3: well, it is difficult. That's the issue with these threads that get longer and longer - they take expontentially more time to follow.
[20:29] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; our meetings aren't about those either yet.
[20:30] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, what I don't understand is that from that number of pings and the review of the virtualbox SRU how did we end up in a situation where nobody from the SRU team though we had a problem that needed to be resolved in some way before promoting the new kernel?
[20:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; Pragmatically, we get stuff done quicker when the involved people can speak to each other high bandwidth without excessive bureaucracy
[20:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: those kinds of technical details I think are something best worked through by the SRU team as we sort out responding to the email
[20:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; seb128: I'm not aware that anybody flagged virtualbox as being broken by the new kernel.
[20:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; At least, not to the SRU team.
[20:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; Another complication is that the kernel SRU process operates fairly independently
[20:31] &lt;seb128&gt; vorlon, ack
[20:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; Eickmeyer: private matters regarding individuals&gt; I disagree. The complaints posted _are_ accusatory of the conduct of individuals.
[20:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; independently of the rest of the SRU team, and also independently of the britney-triggered autopkgtests
[20:34] &lt;rbasak&gt; There are various aspects of this matter that I am deliberately not going into here because it is inappropriate to discuss them publicly.
[20:35] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; rbasak: Why is the SRU team discussing complaints of the conduct of individuals? That seems out of scope?
[20:35]  * Eickmeyer is confused
[20:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think it is in scope, but I cannot explain why exactly without going into private matters.
[20:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'd be happy to explain to the TB in private, or to the CC in private.
[20:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; But an escalation to the CC at this stage I think would be counterproductive. We need to stop being accusatory and try and resolve this constructively.
[20:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok it's clear that the ball is in the SRU team's court for responding to the email, and I think we've exhausted any useful informal discussion here on the topic.  Moving on
[20:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002862.html launchpad-buildd-admin team ownership
[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; On that topic, Ubuntu's infrastructure provision arrangements from Canonical pre-date my involvement, but there's plenty of stuff that we rely very heavily on Canonical IS for, and I don't see any reason why this case needs to be an exception. So following the existing pattern, it makes sense to me to delegate management of this stuff to Canonical, just like various other infrastructure where we
[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; already do that.
[20:38] &lt;rbasak&gt; So +1 from me
[20:38] &lt;vorlon&gt; wgrant had approached me privately about this earlier and I said I had no reservations but that it should be public
[20:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; of anyone likely to be accidentally exercising this privilege, it would be those members of the Archive Admin team that *happen* to also be on the TB (me, sil2100, seb128)
[20:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; and there's no reason for that to be the case
[20:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; and if we need stuff as AAs we can work that out directly with launchpad instead
[20:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; any objections?
[20:39] &lt;amurray&gt; +1 from me too (although I can't help but notice that since all current TB members are Canonical employees I wonder if there is a perceived conflict of interest in being asked about this)
[20:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; well. given that this is true it would still only be Canonical employees able to *exercise* that acl
[20:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; and afaik none of us do
[20:40] &lt;amurray&gt; indeed

[20:45] &lt;seb128&gt; we missed https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002864.html in the list review
[20:45] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (not bringing it up right now, but I have a question related to Lubuntu LTS requalification at some point before AOB ends)
[20:45] &lt;seb128&gt; we should have somone doing the review and call for a vote if it's ready
[20:46] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; w.r.t. the Kubuntu LTS requalification, I see that Scarlett didn't list any official contacts. This was a hang-up for Lubuntu, and I know who the contacts are. Would it be helpful for me to reply to that email with that info so that someone from the Kubuntu Council can +1 it?
[20:47] &lt;vorlon&gt; arraybolt3: might speed things up, sure
[20:47] &lt;vorlon&gt; to be clear, flavors don't need to feel any urgency about this process (there was one email apologizing for being late)
[20:47] &lt;vorlon&gt; we have until April to make final decisions
[20:47] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; To be fair, that's only 2 months with lots of stuff to do in between.
[20:48] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; still, good to know that we aren't already too late (I was a bit worried with how long Lubuntu was taking, so this is good new info for me to have).
[20:48] &lt;ricktimmis&gt; +1
[20:48] &lt;vorlon&gt; anyone on the TB want to volunteer to drive Kubuntu qual?

[20:49] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; a single thank is good enough *ducks*
[20:50] &lt;ricktimmis&gt; Happy to be point of contact for Kubuntu
[20:50] &lt;vorlon&gt; ricktimmis: apologies, but I have no idea who you are that you are volunteering?
[20:50] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; He is a Kubuntu Council member

[20:51] &lt;vorlon&gt; https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-council/+members gotcha
[20:51] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (them and Scarlett are the contacts)
[20:51] &lt;vorlon&gt; well anyway, Kubuntu folks should among them decide who it's going to be and post to the list please
[20:51] &lt;vorlon&gt; ricktimmis: nice to meet you (after you've been on the Kubuntu Council for 6 years ;)
[20:51] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; ricktimmis: it sounds like you're better equipped to post that info, so I'll leave that alone so I don't mess anything up :P
[20:52] &lt;amurray&gt; yes please, that way I know who to reply to since Scarlett didn't CC anyone else
[20:52] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; ricktimmis: You know me, so if you need help, you know who to find as well.
[20:52] &lt;vorlon&gt; any other AOB?
[20:52] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; o/
[20:53] &lt;rbasak&gt; o/
[20:53] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; is there anything else that needs done for Lubuntu's LTS requalification?
[20:53] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (that was me raising my hand)
[20:53] &lt;ricktimmis&gt; Thx
[20:53] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (sorry, looked like a wave goodbye)
[20:53] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I don't know if it's been officially ratified yet, and this was something Simon wanted to bring up.
[20:54] &lt;vorlon&gt; thanks for checking
[20:55] &lt;vorlon&gt; looking at the mailing list archive I find myself confused because I was pretty sure there was a reply to my question about the contacts on list but I don't see it there
[20:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; It wasn't threaded
[20:55] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; sec, I'll dig it up
[20:55] &lt;vorlon&gt; rbasak: yah but I don't see it at all?

[20:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; Oh - it's not in the archive?
[20:56] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I'm seeing it as my reply to Lubuntu LTS Requalificatoin: 24.04 Noble Numbat
[20:56] &lt;vorlon&gt; rbasak: *that* email was before my question, where the answer referenced that other email
[20:56] &lt;rbasak&gt; https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002851.html is what I thought we're talking about
[20:56] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I definitely sent it to the list
[20:56] &lt;vorlon&gt; so anyway uh list archive maybe broken
[20:56] &lt;vorlon&gt; but I have it in my local mail archive
[20:56] &lt;rbasak&gt; Oh, I see.
[20:56] &lt;rbasak&gt; I didn't receive that email in that case
[20:56] &lt;vorlon&gt; so I'll take the action to follow up and confirm Lubuntu status (I think we have enough +1s and no objections)
[20:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; Oh wait
[20:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; I did get it to ubuntu-release@
[20:57] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; weird, yeah it looks like the archive just swallowed a bunch of stuff.
[20:57] &lt;vorlon&gt; ahhhh

[20:57] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; ah, yep, that's it
[20:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; technical-board@ wasn't included from then onwards
[20:58] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; oh
[20:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; (it was neither in To: nor Cc:)
[20:58]  * arraybolt3 missed we were hunting through the technical-board ML, I thought this was ubuntu-release :P
[20:58] &lt;vorlon&gt; you even suckered a member of the TB to posting their +1 only to ubuntu-release

[05:55] &lt;blahdeblah&gt; Out of curiosity, how often do old vulns get reevaluated?  Our corporate vuln management tool is complaining about https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-3864 on my fully-patched jammy system.
[05:55] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- A flaw was found in the way the dumpable flag setting was handled when certain SUID binaries executed its descendants. The prerequisite is a SUID binary that sets real UID equal to effective UID, and real GID equal to effective GID. The descendant will then have a dumpable value set to 1. As a result, if the descendant process crashes and core_pattern is set to a re... &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3864&gt;
[07:02] &lt;amurray&gt; blahdeblah: the ubuntu cve page for this has a note from sbeattie saying there is no official fix from upstream for this as of 2022-01-27 - I am assuming this is still the case
[07:04] &lt;blahdeblah&gt; Yep, saw that; just wondered if it is still true, given that note was the last time the entry appears to have changed.
[09:12] &lt;Apparmortastic&gt; georgiag that's interesting, then my question becomes, has libnss-resolve ever worked on apparmor based systems?
[09:13] &lt;Apparmortastic&gt; because if i understand flags=(attach_disconnected) right, it's a security issue to do so and i would have to add it to all profiles that need internet, which is all of them
[11:29] &lt;georgiag&gt; Apparmortastic: I'm not sure, I'd have to check. I was basing myself only on the "allowed" log you pasted. we are currently working on improving attach_disconnected because it's very permissive, but a lot of applications need it. depending on the version you're running, you can specify the path using flags=(attach_disconnected.path=/foo)
[11:42] &lt;Apparmortastic&gt; georgiag i made a bug report https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apparmor/+bug/2051506 for this
[11:42] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- Launchpad bug 2051506 in apparmor (Ubuntu) "apparmor blocks libnss-resolve socket" [Undecided, Confirmed]
[11:46] &lt;georgiag&gt; Apparmortastic: thanks!
[17:22] &lt;sbeattie&gt; blahdeblah: we do periodically go back through the cves that don't have an identified upstream fix, though the ones that are older get less focesed attention.
[17:23] &lt;sbeattie&gt; blahdeblah: looking at that specific cve, I'm not seeing a fix that landed upstream for it, and both redhat and suse closed out their associated bug reports with wontfix. :/

[16:36] &lt;Apparmortastic&gt; hey, i am trying to use libnss-resolve, when I `aa-disable ping` then i can resolve things using libnss-resolve because i can access the socket `/run/systemd/resolve/io.systemd.Resolve` but if i do `aa-complain ping` or `aa-enforce ping` i can not, why would complain block access and why is /run/systemd/resolve/io.systemd.Resolve blocked to begin

[16:36] &lt;Apparmortastic&gt; the only log entry relevant is this one, seemingly allowing the connection

[16:36] &lt;Apparmortastic&gt; but if i aa-disable, no worries, works fine
[17:10] &lt;georgiag&gt; Apparmortastic: the socket must be in a different namespace than the process trying to access it. to enable permission to do this, you need to add flags=(attach_disconnected) in the ping profile
[18:15] &lt;KarlG100&gt; Greetings, have a sanity check question.
[18:15] &lt;KarlG100&gt; I'm working on deploying smartcard enfocement on 22.04, and running into what I think is a pam_sss bug.
[18:16] &lt;KarlG100&gt; when require_cert_auth is added to the pam_sss.so line all methods of logging in seem to work and reject password based auth, except ssh.
[18:17] &lt;KarlG100&gt; does anyone know/tracking any issues in the stock pam_sss with the require_cert_auth and rejecting password based auth?

[16:20] &lt;juliank&gt; This is the firefox postinst failing to contact snap store, not the u-r-u itself
[16:22] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Agreed
[16:22] &lt;juliank&gt; I mean this must a snapd bug or a server outage or something?
[16:22] &lt;juliank&gt; I'm inclined to swap u-r-u for snapd
[16:22] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Its weird because the chromium snap update right before that succeeds
[16:22] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Every time in testing
[16:22] &lt;Skia&gt; probably not a server outage, it's been consistant for like 2 months
[16:23] &lt;juliank&gt; ok but what would the action for us be here?
[16:23] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I don't think there is an action for Foundations this was just originally reported about u-r-u
[16:24] &lt;juliank&gt; it basically fails in snap info firefox

[16:29] &lt;juliank&gt; No volunteers? OK
[16:29] &lt;juliank&gt; python-werkzeug is still with pushkarnk
[16:29] &lt;juliank&gt; there are needs fixing merge requests I saw during patch pilot
[16:29] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; yes, MPs under review, debian merged one of the two MRs
[16:30] &lt;juliank&gt; libxcrypt vs ruby is with adrien
[16:30] &lt;juliank&gt; Not sure about libxcrypt vs exim4, I don't see a previous owner
[16:30] &lt;slyon&gt; pushkarnk: should onionshare be sync'ed from experimental?
[16:30] &lt;slyon&gt; (which is including your fix)
[16:30] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; yes
[16:30] &lt;slyon&gt; I can do that..
[16:31] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; slyon: thanks!
[16:31] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; lektor is the elephant in the room :/
[16:31] &lt;juliank&gt; I guess we assumed all libxcrypt is with adrien last week
[16:31] &lt;juliank&gt; adrien: does that work?
[16:32] &lt;adrien&gt; I'm waiting for a review
[16:32] &lt;juliank&gt; ok
[16:32] &lt;xypron&gt; I would like to look into 'apport'. Seems to rsyslog related.
[16:32] &lt;juliank&gt; systemd-hwe is with enr0n
[16:32] &lt;enr0n&gt; juliank: that migrated
[16:32] &lt;juliank&gt; ah cool
[16:33] &lt;juliank&gt; ok let's hunt for more
[16:33] &lt;schopin&gt; adrien: could you tag your bugs awaiting review as update-excuse so that it shows up on the report?
[16:34] &lt;adrien&gt; oops, sure, sorry about that
[16:34] &lt;juliank&gt; apt I guess is with me
[16:34] &lt;adrien&gt; schopin: ah but I don't have a bug, only an MR
[16:35] &lt;juliank&gt; btrfs-progs vs dracut I'll go pick bdrung
[16:35] &lt;adrien&gt; (for reference: https://code.launchpad.net/~adrien-n/ubuntu/+source/ruby3.1/+git/ruby3.1/+merge/459015 )
[16:35] &lt;juliank&gt; (yes it's part of python3 transition but also not related to it in terms of failure)
[16:36] &lt;xypron&gt; I could also have a look at 'rich'.
[16:36] &lt;juliank&gt; None of these are on the list?
[16:37] &lt;juliank&gt; I'm skipping over the python 3 transition too mostly
[16:37] &lt;bdmurray&gt; check-postgres on armhf looks strange (the one with liblocale-gettext-perl as a trigger)
[16:40] &lt;juliank&gt; I don't think we can go investigate the perl and python stuff this all needs to be retried and then if stuff is still broken and the list is smaller we go look at it?
[16:40] &lt;ginggs&gt; bdmurray: 2024-01-21 02:40:37 UTC ?
[16:40] &lt;juliank&gt; And I should build a filtered list excluding the transitions locally
[16:41] &lt;juliank&gt; Lots of waiting stuff
[16:41] &lt;juliank&gt; Nothing really actionable right now afaict
[16:41] &lt;bdmurray&gt; ginggs: yes
[16:41] &lt;juliank&gt; Or like only very small items
[16:42] &lt;ginggs&gt; bdmurray: llvm-toochain-17 was being rebuilt
[16:42] &lt;ravikant_&gt; I volunteer for a small item
[16:42] &lt;ginggs&gt; it finished on 2024-01-21 04:26:17 UTC
[16:43] &lt;ginggs&gt; https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/llvm-toolchain-17/1:17.0.6-5build1/+build/27661259
[16:44] &lt;juliank&gt; I guess let's revisit the queue next week, the perl transition is still blocking a lot of runs that need retrying
[16:44] &lt;juliank&gt; #topic AOB
[16:44] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; public holiday in India tomorrow
[16:45] &lt;ogayot&gt; I'll be off next week
[16:45] &lt;Skia&gt; I'm off Monday and Tuesday
[16:46] &lt;mateus-morais&gt; I'm off tomorrow and Monday
[16:47] &lt;adrien&gt; fosdem is in 10 days \o/
[16:48] &lt;juliank&gt; Reminder that carry-over days remain until end of March :)
[16:48] &lt;juliank&gt; I will *not* be at FOSDEM
[16:48] &lt;schopin&gt; Oh right, thanks for the reminder for the carryover!
[16:49] &lt;juliank&gt; And that wraps up this meeting I believe!

[12:15] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; arraybolt3: thanks! looking at it now
[19:27] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; looks like I have today only if I want to get TigerVNC out the door for Lunar :P am I in time?
[19:36] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; arraybolt3: sure :)
[19:36] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; I can publish it tomorrow too
[19:39] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; kk, getting the VMs set up now (this will take a while but I should be done before the end of today)
[19:40] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; cool, I'll publish them first thing tomorrow morning, before we shoot lunar in the head :)
[19:42] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; (in back of the security team barn)
[19:47] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; grief
[21:33] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: i want in on some of that action. *brings the incendiary rounds for the deed*
[21:34] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; teward: whoa, we're just putting it out of its misery, not burning the whole barn down!
[21:35] &lt;teward&gt; :P
[21:36] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; when was teward ever about *not* burning the whole barn down?
[21:36] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; *ducks*
[21:36] &lt;teward&gt; *puts arraybolt3 in the salt mines*
[21:36] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; arraybolt3: ah, true :)
[21:38] &lt;teward&gt; well if the barn catches fire then we have to build a better barn :P
[21:42] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; sheesh so it took me like 30 minutes to figure out how on earth to get TigerVNC working because the documentation was so scattered. I literally had to resort to the Arch Wiki to get it going.
[21:43] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; anyway currently installing Lunar, then going to go to Jammy and Focal, these should go *fairly* fast.

[13:22] &lt;allenpthuang&gt; hey jdstrand, re: postfix, I will work on updates based on those new versions next week. Thanks again for the heads up! :D

[17:19] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; mdeslaur and whoever else: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tigervnc/+bug/2048442/comments/2 I have MOTU upload permissions, can I just upload fixed TigerVNC packages myself, or do I have to attach these as debdiffs because the Security Team is involved?
[17:19] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- Launchpad bug 2048442 in tigervnc (Ubuntu Mantic) "CVE-2023-1393 and TigerVNC" [Medium, New]
[17:19] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (obviously the fixes will have to go through the SRU process, but I mean for the initial upload to -proposed.)
[17:39] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; arraybolt3: hi! if it fixes a CVE, it needs to go through security updates, not the SRU process, so please attach debdiffs to the bug, and subscribe ubuntu-security-sponsors to it, and whoever is on sponsoring duty this week will take a look
[17:39] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; (D'OH I'M ON SPONSORING DUTY THIS WEEK)
[17:39] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; arraybolt3: the updates need to be built in the security team ppa, as it builds without -updates enabled, so you unfortunately can't upload it directly yourself
[18:02] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; mdeslaur: makes sense, thanks!
[18:02] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; you can probably count on me having debdiffs later today, hopefully.
[18:08] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; arraybolt3: awesome, ping me here when uploaded, and I'll take a look
=== sdeziel_ is now known as sdeziel
[20:58] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; mdeslaur: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tigervnc/+bug/2048442 all four affected releases now have debdiffs awaiting review. Thank you!
[20:58] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- Launchpad bug 2048442 in tigervnc (Ubuntu Mantic) "CVE-2023-1393 and TigerVNC" [Medium, New]
[21:02] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; mdeslaur: before you accept any of those, please note that I did **not** already test the actual installation and functionality of those debdiffs, I did this like an SRU and expected things would go to the -proposed pocket.
[21:02] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I'm only just now seeing that doesn't happen for security updates.
[21:03] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I don't have time to do the actual testing of them right now, so if you have to hold off on doing anything with those, that's fine, I'll get around to it ASAP.
[21:08] &lt;sarnold&gt; arraybolt3: thanks :) the usual process involves asking the uploader to test the built binaries, to ensure that what we're about to ship to users works as expected
[21:11] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; sarnold: to be clear, the binaries as built by the debdiff builder themselves? Or does the Security team upload them to their PPA and then testing is done? (This is my first security update so I'm very hazy on just about everything that differs from the traditional SRU process as you could probably tell :P)
[21:11] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (I didn't realize this was handled at all different than an SRU right up until I mentioned that I didn't test things already.
[21:12] &lt;sarnold&gt; arraybolt3: yeah, mdeslaur will upload to a ppa, and then ask you to test those, describe the testing done, etc
[21:12] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; ahhhh ok that's similar to what I'm used to then. Perfect, then I think we're on track.

# UBUNTU-MEETING

[15:31] &lt;sarnold&gt; good morning
[15:31] &lt;eslerm&gt; good morning o/
[15:31] &lt;sarnold&gt; probably I should have asked last week if we were going to have this particular meeting :)
[15:33] &lt;eslerm&gt; only thing I have to report is that Security will pickup speexdsp after rok-toolkit is reviewed
[15:34] &lt;eslerm&gt; there is a lot of time in the cycle, and it will be best if the same reviewer can do both
[15:35] &lt;eslerm&gt; s/a lot of/enough
[15:39] &lt;sarnold&gt; heya slyon, since it's just eslerm and I we hadn't bothered starting the meeting
[15:39] &lt;sarnold&gt; slyon: depending on if you're actually around or if this is just your client auto-joining..
[15:39] &lt;slyon&gt; hey!
[15:39] &lt;slyon&gt; I was distracted, sorry.
[15:39] &lt;slyon&gt; But considering many are sprinting, and there's not a lot on the agenda, I'd suggest we skip today's meeting?
[15:40] &lt;sarnold&gt; wfm
[15:40] &lt;eslerm&gt; +1
[15:40] &lt;slyon&gt; I just briefly checked our queues and it's looking pretty empty
[15:40] &lt;sarnold&gt; nice
[15:41] &lt;sarnold&gt; .. at least I hope it isn't the outrush before a tsunami
[15:42] &lt;slyon&gt; Yeah, let's hope it stays calm like this.
[15:43] &lt;slyon&gt; component-mismatches don't show anything new, but there's still some time until import freeze :)

[14:49] &lt;jdstrand_&gt; hey, I see that postfix was updated in https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-6591-1 (thanks!). I noticed there is a refined patch to use 'smtpd_forbid_bare_newline = normalize' which improves compatibility while still closing the issue: https://www.postfix.org/announcements/postfix-3.8.5.html. Is Ubuntu planning on updating for this?
=== jdstrand_ is now known as jdstrand
[14:51] &lt;jdstrand&gt; allenpthuang: ^
[14:53] &lt;sdeziel&gt; it doesn't help discoverability that this refinement isn't mentioned in the timeline on https://www.postfix.org/smtp-smuggling.html
[14:53] &lt;jdstrand&gt; it doesn't
[14:53] &lt;jdstrand&gt; I saw it on oss-sec
[15:07] &lt;amurray&gt; hey (and thanks for the heads up) jdstrand - allenpthuang is on a training course but will take a look later today
[15:13] &lt;jdstrand&gt; amurray: ack, thanks!
=== JanC_ is now known as JanC
[23:08] &lt;allenpthuang&gt; hey jdstrand (re: postfix patch) thanks for the heads up! I took a quick look and can confirm I was working on those updates based on the versions 3.8.4, 3.7.9, 3.6.13 and 3.5.23. And I now find they update the page (https://www.postfix.org/smtp-smuggling.html) with the newer version you mentioned. I'll have another further look to see what I can
[23:08] &lt;allenpthuang&gt; do tomorrow :)

[19:02] &lt;seb128&gt; hey there, sorry but I'm still busy with evening things and will be at the computer only in ~10min
[19:02] &lt;seb128&gt; Andy was supposed to be on the agenda for tonight according to the list archives but he was edited out of the wiki?
[19:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; rbasak, bdmurray, kanashiro, seb128, sil2100, teward: mind if we skip?
[19:02] &lt;seb128&gt; +1 for skipping since ^
[19:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; seb128: he withdrew the application as he's not interested in pursuing core-dev anymore
[19:03] &lt;seb128&gt; just checking that that was not a mistake
[19:03] &lt;seb128&gt; hum, ok, I didn't see his follow up and shame :(
[19:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; he communicated that internally to me and I dropped him from the agenda
[19:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; the reason wasn't mine to speak so I let it be :)
[19:03] &lt;seb128&gt; ah ok, thanks for the context
[19:03] &lt;seb128&gt; anyway I'm fine skipping
[19:04] &lt;seb128&gt; I be to step away for 10min or so now anyway

[16:08] &lt;schopin&gt; bdmurray: yeah I scratched my head vigorously when upils came to me on that one.
[16:10] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Could somebody elaborate on it?
[16:10] &lt;vorlon&gt; why would you have a tab after a filename in a patch
[16:10] &lt;vorlon&gt; sorry
[16:10] &lt;vorlon&gt; why would you have content after a filename in a patch
[16:10] &lt;cpete&gt; why does the filename contain spaces?
[16:10] &lt;vorlon&gt; because it's legal
[16:11] &lt;schopin&gt; because patch(1) is weird that way?
[16:11] &lt;bdmurray&gt; even cpete is old enough to know don't use spaces in a filename
[16:11] &lt;vorlon&gt; I guell diff $oldfile $newfile means you have to have a delimeter
[16:11] &lt;schopin&gt; if you don't have the \t it won't be able to parse the filename correctly if it has spaces in it.
[16:11] &lt;vorlon&gt; oh you mean a filename with nothing after it except a magic \t ?!
[16:12] &lt;schopin&gt; Yes.
[16:12] &lt;vorlon&gt; and you ended up with a patch where you had to manually add this?

[16:12] &lt;schopin&gt; Combine that with people using fancy editors that will remove trailing whitespace automatically...
[16:13] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Who would do that?
[16:13] &lt;dbungert&gt; sounds like a text editor bug
[16:13] &lt;juliank&gt; doko raised bug 2049686 and assigned it to the security team
[16:13] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2049686 in dpkg (Ubuntu) "dpkg-buildflags: emit build flags for negated features" [High, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2049686
[16:13] &lt;juliank&gt; I'm not sure why it's also tagged incoming
[16:14] &lt;juliank&gt; This seems like work we need to do and not the security team?
[16:15] &lt;juliank&gt; Well I pinged doko on the bug for more info
[16:15] &lt;juliank&gt; We can revisit it next week?

[16:16] &lt;juliank&gt; so we said this probably isn't possible under wayland but I don't think anyone had some spare time and interest to check?
[16:17] &lt;schopin&gt; We should probably create a spike card and untag.
[16:18] &lt;juliank&gt; creating one
[16:18] &lt;juliank&gt; FR-6347
[16:18] &lt;vorlon&gt; but also I don't think that's noble-critical
[16:19] &lt;vorlon&gt; or noble-realistic
[16:19] &lt;juliank&gt; it's also not targeted to noble, so I guess it's ok
[16:19] &lt;juliank&gt; And I dropped the tag

[16:20] &lt;juliank&gt; I remember similar bug elsewhere (but don't remember where) and I believe we should probably fix that

[16:21] &lt;juliank&gt; targeted and tagged todo

[16:24] &lt;juliank&gt; #link https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs
[16:25] &lt;adrien&gt; I didn't finish libxcrypt (or libcryptx?) and ruby but it's in progress
[16:25] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; browsers crashing in 3... 2... 1...
[16:25] &lt;juliank&gt; so vorlon I assigned I think 3 items last week in alphabetical order increasing, so we gotta kind of go backwards or something to make it fair :)
[16:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; heh
[16:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; well 2 weeks ago is the last time I assigned anything
[16:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; let's see here
[16:26] &lt;dbungert&gt; textmode browsers can give better results when the proposed-migration report gets this long
[16:26] &lt;bdmurray&gt; dbungert: a what?
[16:26] &lt;adrien&gt; heh, update_excuses_by_team seems to require much more memory than update_excuses
[16:26] &lt;dbungert&gt; bdmurray: like links or w3m
[16:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-werkzeug looks like last week was moved from slyon to pushkarnk
[16:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; pushkarnk: is this still in progress?
[16:27] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; vorlon: I have 2 MPs under review
[16:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok
[16:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; debconf is assigned to enr0n - you ok to keep that?
[16:29] &lt;enr0n&gt; vorlon: yes - I triggered a retry earlier in the week but never saw a result, so I tried again
[16:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; sorry, browser crashed (uh because of that page's memory usage probably), taking a minute to get back in order here
[16:31] &lt;bdmurray&gt; enr0n: and it was queued again when you retried it?
[16:31] &lt;juliank&gt; still need to sort out python-apt and apt it's a bit messy right now
[16:31] &lt;enr0n&gt; bdmurray: yes
[16:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; netplan.io vs wpa: ogayot was working on this and raised an MP against britney to badtest it which I rejected
[16:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; ogayot: are you still working on this?
[16:32] &lt;ogayot&gt; vorlon: yes, I'm still working on it, with slyon's help too
[16:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok
[16:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; libxcrypt: adrien: are you ok to keep this?
[16:33] &lt;adrien&gt; yeah
[16:33] &lt;adrien&gt; I solved it locally, I need to do an MR
[16:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; apt vs systemd: I don't see this one mentioned as currently assigned
[16:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; so I guess that brings us to the new stuff
[16:33] &lt;adrien&gt; btw, it's impacting ncurses too I think (it's purely in ruby, and everything ruby3.1 will fail)
[16:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok, apt vs systemd. enr0n you uploaded systemd, do you want to follow up on this or do you want someone else to take it?
[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; looks like there are a good number of autopkgtests needing sorted for systemd, not just apt
[16:37] &lt;enr0n&gt; vorlon: I am working on another systemd upload (real failures in systemd's tests), so yes consider that with me
[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok
[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; enr0n: I assume systemd-hwe is similar, since it's your upload and it's your autopkgtests that are failing
[16:38] &lt;enr0n&gt; vorlon: yes, systemd-hwe needs the new systemd
[16:38] &lt;vorlon&gt; but doesn't declare a versioned dependency on it?
[16:39] &lt;juliank&gt; heh I said the same thing but I don't remember wehre
[16:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; (if it needs the new systemd at runtime and you declare a versioned dependency for this the autopkgtests would just dtrt I think; and also it would dtrt on the user's system...)
[16:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; gnutls28, I'll take; just some autopkgtests to chase on ppc64el it looks like
[16:39] &lt;schopin&gt; Wouldn't the autopkgtests just end up with all-proposed?
[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; um and then the perl transition
[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; so I'm not going to try to dig through here to find things to assign out
[16:40] &lt;juliank&gt; heh
[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: back to you :)
[16:41] &lt;enr0n&gt; it's just for autopkgtest; the path to a test binary changed
[16:41] &lt;juliank&gt; I still am sorting out apt and python-apt, enr0n are you planning any ubuntu-release-upgrader upload?
[16:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; enr0n: ok
[16:41] &lt;enr0n&gt; juliank: no nothing planned at the moment
[16:41] &lt;juliank&gt; Otherwise I can go and upload a version that adapts to the new deb822 ordering changes in python-apt myself
[16:41] &lt;juliank&gt; ack
[16:41] &lt;juliank&gt; #topic AOB
[16:42] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I know I'm not a part of this meeting, but https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxc/+bug/2039873 is something that's been going on for a while. My suggestion would be to ask Foundations to help. Either way, now you know. *bows back out*
[16:42] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2039873 in lxc (Ubuntu) "liblxc-dev was built with LXC_DEVEL=1 in Ubuntu 22.04 and later releases" [Undecided, Confirmed]
[16:42] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I'll be out tomorrow afternoon in case anyone notices
[16:42] &lt;juliank&gt; The lxc stuff is being discussed with server team
[16:42] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; &lt;3
[16:43] &lt;juliank&gt; So deb822 ubuntu.sources will be relatively forcefully merged by python-apt and not very good at preserving local layout changes - if it can merge two paragraphs together, it will
[16:43] &lt;juliank&gt; You can give them separate comments and it won't
[16:44] &lt;juliank&gt; We need to revisit a deb822 native experience that is better at preserving layout, ultimately the experience would be worse with the current API without that level of merging
[16:45] &lt;juliank&gt; (because it needs to split up entries some times, and you then want them to not remain split if you undo your change, you know)
[16:45] &lt;adrien&gt; vorlon: I didn't have time to dig in the exim/gnutls one yet but it can/should be for me
[16:46] &lt;adrien&gt; (but I don't have a ppc64el machine which might be annoying for reproducing the issue)
[16:47] &lt;vorlon&gt; adrien: oh ok
[16:47] &lt;juliank&gt; Oh we've been silent for a minute, not counting vorlon's oh ok, so I guess we can call it

[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; not sure anymore, it was long long ago

[15:39] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2015538 in dbus-broker (Ubuntu) "[MIR] dbus-broker" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:40] &lt;mkukri&gt; i unfortunately didnt have time to impove python3-cssselect today, but will have it done by next week
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; That is a Debian maintainer and upstream systemd contributor offering to help
[15:40] &lt;eslerm&gt; I asked SEG and there wasn't extra capacity to take dbus-brokers wrapper
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; But it will still be O-release
[15:40] &lt;slyon&gt; mkukri: please coordinate with joalif about that (maybe it's not needed)
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: interesting, what was the answer?
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is kind of a very soon or in 24.10 atm right?
[15:41] &lt;eslerm&gt; it was a favor request, they mentioned that they were tight on people but someone *might* be interested to take it on
[15:41] &lt;eslerm&gt; adding the wrapper likely needs to go on a roadmap
[15:41] &lt;sarnold&gt; yeah, and it's a large enough change that even if it were done today, I think there'd be serious questions about switching to it now
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; by not finding time we are also becoming one of the few that have not yet switched :-/
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; fedora changed ages ago, arch did announce the same last week
[15:42] &lt;sarnold&gt; err .. the first "large change" is switching dbus implementations; the second "it were done today" was the (presumably) smallish wrapper
[15:42] &lt;eslerm&gt; Security eyeballed how much work the wrapper would take during the review. There's a little bit of process state handling, but not much
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; maybe the link is worth adding to second the rationale?
[15:43] &lt;eslerm&gt; I can
[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'll add it
[15:44] &lt;slyon&gt; dbus-broker was mostly driven by desktop. I wonder if seb128 is interested in merging v35 (even though it's in universe)? Just to keep it up to date
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I still doubt this can happen without Desktop finding and dedicating resources to it
[15:45] &lt;slyon&gt; adding the wrapper is another story then
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ack
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; in the context of the MIR meeting this is interesting but not blocking us
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; would one ping Seb and others to ensure they reconsider it again as it is kind of the last chance to do so?
[15:46] &lt;slyon&gt; I can

[15:47] &lt;eslerm&gt; not a major roadmap item atm, but there is related work to do
[15:47] &lt;slyon&gt; verdict was that the Foundations toolchain squad does not have capacity to work on it this cycle, but security might start working on some relevant tooling

[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; I'm training the certs/fips folks for MIRs after this meeting (libgssglue) and setting up similar meeting for fdk-aac-free
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; well, that is great to hear
[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; the perl ones are more or less done, it would be nice if another perl one was ready
[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; libmysofa is still in upstream's hands iiuc
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; libmail-mime-perl is in TODO
[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; openscap is a backlog security task (not for MIR)
[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; I'm not aware of roc-toolkit yet
[15:49]  * eslerm looks
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; arr, that was one that was switched away
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; you might want to remove the card in your jira though
[15:50] &lt;slyon&gt; eslerm: I finished roc-toolkit MIR review today. It's ready for security review
[15:50] &lt;eslerm&gt; \o/
[15:50] &lt;eslerm&gt; I'll try to assign it this week
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'll ping mirespace if there are any more perl MIRs waiting to get them to us asap for you to be able to use them for training
[15:51] &lt;eslerm&gt; thank you
[15:51] &lt;eslerm&gt; Andrei has worked up a perl fuzzing process for those
[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, I pinged mirespace about it
[15:52] &lt;eslerm&gt; perl turns out not to be great for training though :)
[15:52] &lt;mirespace&gt; cpaelzer: They all are submitted
[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ah
[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; well, great
[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; afte rso many months of yet another no one thought of that to be possible :-)
[15:52] &lt;mirespace&gt; hehe... well, let's see how libcryptX evolves :(
[15:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; mirespace: woo :) nice work working those through :)
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; mirespace: libcryptx was the bad one enmbedding another version of a lib right?
[15:53] &lt;mirespace&gt; thanks sarnold! :$
[15:53] &lt;mirespace&gt; yes, that one
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; *sigh*
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; why can't things ever be easy
[15:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; mirespace: hmm, reading the comment
[15:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it seems you wait for us on this
[15:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but by being assigned to you it won't show up in any query
[15:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; let me lÃ¶ink it here
[15:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; for us to have a look now
[15:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libcryptx-perl/+bug/2046154
[15:54] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2046154 in libcryptx-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libcryptx-perl (libmail-dkim-perl dependency)" [Undecided, New]
[15:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'd appreciate we all could have a look to conclude on ways forward
[15:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; option #1 sounds even worse :-/
[15:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; for #2 - sad that even that ed25519 uses the embedded tomcrypt
[15:56] &lt;eslerm&gt; I'll bring this LP up during the fips/certs mir training
[15:56] &lt;slyon&gt; maybe adrien does have an opinion on that?
[15:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I see how #3 is the easiest, but OTOH the one taking way the function users want from this whole stack of tools
[15:57] &lt;eslerm&gt; slyon: I'll ask
[15:57] &lt;mirespace&gt; I'm  working on trying to separate ed255519 from dkim itself at putting it like recommend... there is a sodium based perl lib that that handles also ed255519, but is pretty abandoned
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think I miss #4 - make this an optional dependency, so that some encryptions work out of the bux and others are a suggest to a universe package
[15:58] &lt;mirespace&gt; (sorry, I put a extra that )
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; really I'd love to see adriens and eslerm (after bringing it up) thoughts on this
[15:58] &lt;sarnold&gt; I'd love to know if they're abandoned because they are working fine and don't need maintaining, or if they're so busted that the authors gave up :(
[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; after all they might say "ok, while not great - using it as is is the least bad option"
[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I mean I found that the embedded lib is more up to date than the lib itself
[15:59] &lt;sarnold&gt; ha
[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; time is running out
[15:59] &lt;mirespace&gt; (sorry, I need to drop ... thank you all)
[15:59] &lt;sarnold&gt; bye mirespace :) thanks
[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; looking forwadr to seeing your comment on the case later on
[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we all need to drop ...
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic Any other business?
[16:00] &lt;sarnold&gt; noen here
[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; last minute urgent things?

[20:03] &lt;seb128&gt; sorry for being a bit late
[20:04] &lt;seb128&gt; #startmeeting Ubuntu Technical Board
[20:04] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 20:04:01 UTC.  The chair is seb128.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

[20:04] &lt;seb128&gt; #topic Apologies
[20:05] &lt;seb128&gt; amurray is the only one who refused the calendar event but he seems around?
[20:05] &lt;seb128&gt; no email on the list from what I can see
[20:05] &lt;seb128&gt; #topic Action review
[20:05] &lt;amurray&gt; vorlon mentioned in a private channel that he would be afk
[20:05] &lt;seb128&gt; ok
[20:05] &lt;seb128&gt; ACTION: seb128/amurray/sil2100 to help drafting the snap-store Ubuntu-specific tracks usage
[20:06] &lt;eslerm&gt; amurray is ooo on my calendar
[20:06] &lt;seb128&gt; right, I said that :)
[20:06] &lt;amurray&gt; i'm here ;)
[20:07] &lt;seb128&gt; so on the tracks usage, I replied to a comment
[20:07] &lt;seb128&gt; unsure what is missing for us to be able to move forward from where we are
[20:07] &lt;seb128&gt; amurray, any opinion on what should be the next steps there?
[20:08] &lt;amurray&gt; yeah I am also a bit unsure - I wonder if we need a google meet session or similar to review the remaining comments as a group?
[20:09] &lt;amurray&gt; or we need to engage the store team to figure out if they can support the requirements
[20:10] &lt;seb128&gt; ok, let's carry over and I will take an action item to set up a meeting specifically to discuss that topic
[20:10] &lt;seb128&gt; including other stakeholders if needed
[20:10] &lt;seb128&gt; #action: seb128/amurray/sil2100 to help drafting the snap-store Ubuntu-specific tracks usage

[20:15] &lt;sil2100&gt; Done!
[20:15] &lt;sil2100&gt; Indeed

[20:17] &lt;seb128&gt; that happened as well I think?
[20:17] &lt;amurray&gt; sorry I think I need to carry this over
[20:17] &lt;seb128&gt; https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002844.html ?
[20:17] &lt;seb128&gt; or was there another follow up needed?
[20:17] &lt;amurray&gt; gah yes I forgot
[20:18] &lt;seb128&gt; I overlooked that in my backlog, I will add my vote after the meeting
[20:18] &lt;sil2100&gt; I think I did vote, right?
[20:18] &lt;seb128&gt; yes, and Steve
[20:19] &lt;seb128&gt; I'm going to send my +1 in a bit
[20:19] &lt;seb128&gt; amurray, I'm giving you an action item to send the confirmation of the vote result then if that's ok?
[20:19] &lt;amurray&gt; yes thats fine

[20:20] &lt;seb128&gt; https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/date.html
[20:20] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; o/ :)
[20:20] &lt;seb128&gt; we have a request from Lubuntu to be LTS
[20:21] &lt;seb128&gt; https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002849.html
[20:22] &lt;sil2100&gt; Since I finished mine, maybe I could get assigned to it then
[20:22] &lt;seb128&gt; sil2100, what would be the action item?
[20:22] &lt;seb128&gt; the request seems reasonable so maybe we just need to vote?
[20:22] &lt;sil2100&gt; We can, but I didn't read it! Yet
[20:23] &lt;seb128&gt; sil2100, but thanks, let me add an action to review and call for a vote?
[20:23] &lt;seb128&gt; #action sil2100 to review the lubuntu LTS participation request and follow up as appropriate (question or call for vote)
[20:23] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: sil2100 to review the lubuntu LTS participation request and follow up as appropriate (question or call for vote)
[20:23] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I'm happy to answer any questions here or at a later point about Lubuntu's application. :)
[20:23] &lt;seb128&gt; sil2100, ^ sounds fine?
[20:24] &lt;sil2100&gt; Looks fine o/ Are you and amurray ready to vote as is?
[20:24] &lt;amurray&gt; yes
[20:24] &lt;seb128&gt; I want to read the emails again since I only glanced over them but it feels like it is ready
[20:25] &lt;seb128&gt; let's just do a call for vote on the list rather than trying to do it here today
[20:25] &lt;seb128&gt; did any of you had questions here today for tsimonq2 since he joined the meeting for us?
[20:25] &lt;sil2100&gt; I'm leaving it up to you. I'd like someone to do a proper review of it - if someone already did it, I'm fine with voting
[20:26] &lt;seb128&gt; no need to rush I would say
[20:26] &lt;amurray&gt; no, his email is very detailed and covers everything I would have wanted to know
[20:26] &lt;seb128&gt; you have an action item
[20:26] &lt;seb128&gt; we can call for vote on the list once you have reviewed it
[20:26] &lt;seb128&gt; no question from me either
[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Ok o/
[20:27] &lt;seb128&gt; tsimonq2, no question it seems but thanks for taking the time to join the meeting in case we had some
[20:27] &lt;seb128&gt; #topic Check up on community bugs and techboard bugs
[20:27] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Hey, one more thing on this topic, briefly...
[20:27] &lt;seb128&gt; tsimonq2, sure?
[20:28] &lt;seb128&gt; (no activity on the community bugs and techboard bugs)
[20:28] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Actually, two, sorry. I noted lack of cooperation generally speaking on that email, and I've seen a drastic change for the better. I still have some (genuine) questions around the SRU Team given recent events, but I'm planning a postmorteum on virtualbox anyway.
[20:29] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Also, I appointed Aaron and Dan as assistant release managers, there's no direct action required from the TB, but a "hey we see this" would be great. :)
[20:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; Well I asked and was told that no response was expected?
[20:30] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Yes :) I'm glad you saw it, just making a general point to it.
[20:30] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Anyway, those are the points I have, happy to answer any questions.
[20:30] &lt;seb128&gt; I'm not aware the SRU team situation you are referencing to but it doesn't seem to be a TB topic at this point?
[20:31] &lt;seb128&gt; aware of*
[20:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not sure either.
[20:32] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; My general point is, asking for requalification is a two-way agreement. We are happy to provide support for Lubuntu, the only reason I brought it up is to ensure we have support on the other side to be able to move the needle forward.
[20:32] &lt;seb128&gt; tsimonq2, and I've seen the email about the assistant release managers :-)
[20:32] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; seb128: thanks :)
[20:32] &lt;seb128&gt; ok, so seems there is no question/action there but thanks for mentioning those!
[20:32] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Yes of course :)
[20:32] &lt;seb128&gt; #topic Select a chair for the next meeting (next from https://launchpad.net/~techboard/+members)
[20:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; I wonder if there's an opportunity to be talking more via the flavour syncs or something similar
[20:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; I promise I'll be here in time for the next one so you can keep me as chair ;)
[20:33] &lt;seb128&gt; next in the list is Steve and Lukasz as backup
[20:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; Because I'm seeing noises, but without specifics, I'm not in a position to be able to help at all.
[20:33] &lt;seb128&gt; vorlon, hey, and thanks!
[20:35] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, yes, the flavor syncs is a good venue for project discussions with flavor
[20:35] &lt;seb128&gt; flavors
[20:35] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; As far as I'm aware, the TB has an open invite to the Flavor Syncs. If you talk to the Community Team (specifically ilvipero_), he should be able to get you an invite.
[20:35] &lt;seb128&gt; #topic AOB
[20:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; Please do arrange for the SRU team and/or TB to be invited if there's a specific agenda item you have in mind that you'd like to discuss
[20:36] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Absolutely, just finishing with my notes on this one. Thanks :)
[20:36] &lt;seb128&gt; I usually try to join at least the European tz compatible meeting and I think sil2100 has been to some of those as well
[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not aware of having been invited recently
[20:37] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; That sounds like a mistake to me :)
[20:37] &lt;seb128&gt; I think it's an open venue, ask Mauro to be added to the calendar invite if you wish to join
[20:38] &lt;seb128&gt; I usually join as a desktop representative, afaik we didn't have any formal request to have TB members there before
[20:38] &lt;seb128&gt; but I think we should at least review the invite list according to the topics on the agenda
[20:39] &lt;seb128&gt; that's not a meeting the TB own though, but I will still try to ensure we invite the right people
[20:39] &lt;NotEickmeyer&gt; Just pinged the appropriate people to get you all invites. :)
=== NotEickmeyer is now known as Eickmeyer
[20:39] &lt;seb128&gt; :)
[20:39] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; My IRC client with issues. :)
[20:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks!
[20:39] &lt;seb128&gt; ok, I think that should be enough for that topic then
[20:40] &lt;seb128&gt; another other topic?
[20:40] &lt;seb128&gt; giving 3 min and if not then it's a wrap
[20:41] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; rbasak: I understand it's an action item, but an additional poke on the DMB inactivity stuff :)
[20:41] &lt;amurray&gt; nothing from me
[20:41] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I did get frightened for a minute at Aaron's MOTU meeting.
[20:41]  * tsimonq2 is good
[20:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; tsimonq2: I've not been focused on that because it's usually worked out recently
[20:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; If people start getting near the threshold then I'll definitely prioritise that
[20:42] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Okay :)
[20:43] &lt;seb128&gt; alright, seems we are done then
[20:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; Also it was very close to the New Year and I'd expect some disruption/unavailability around then.
[20:43] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Very true.
[20:43] &lt;seb128&gt; thanks everyone!!
[20:43] &lt;seb128&gt; let's wrap?
[20:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; The plans won't change that since it's only sustained absence that would be actionable
[20:44] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I'm okay wrapping, I believe we're on the same page.
[20:44] &lt;seb128&gt; ok, it's a wrap then, thanks everyone!
[20:44] &lt;sil2100&gt; Yeah, I need to apologize for missing out many DMB meetings lately

[20:45] &lt;seb128&gt; sorry for being half around in that DMB meeting, I was sick on that day but still joined to be able to have quorum but I didn't manage to stick around all the time
[20:46] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; seb128: You came in clutch, so you're more than forgiven from all sides, I'm sure. :D
[20:46] &lt;seb128&gt; :-)
[20:46] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Agreed :)
[20:47] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; seb128: And never apologize for being sick. I've had to say that to subordinates I've had in the past.
[20:48] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; (not that you're subordinate to me, but the point still stands)

[01:09] &lt;sarnold&gt; tomreyn: I can't access https://launchpad.net/bugs/2046565 I get the "lost something?" page. are you sure you've got the right visibility flags and subscriptions on it?
[01:11] &lt;tomreyn&gt; sarnold: i can access it when logged in. i filed a "private security" bug. apparently only brian-murray Â§may be notified" about it.
[01:11] &lt;tomreyn&gt; "may be notified"
[01:11] &lt;tomreyn&gt; "other bug subscribers" appears to be empty. whom should i subscribe?
[01:12] &lt;tomreyn&gt; on the top it says "Only the security group can see this information."
[01:12] &lt;sarnold&gt; I wonder if i"m not in the security team? heh
[01:13] &lt;tomreyn&gt; i guess visibility may be limited because it's not an ubuntu project?
[01:13] &lt;sarnold&gt; yeah, that's probably it
[01:13] &lt;tomreyn&gt; https://i.imgur.com/tKNMqGJ.png
[01:13] &lt;sarnold&gt; it's weird because we can see some openstack stuff but maybe not all of it?
[01:14] &lt;sarnold&gt; if this is apport, please also subscribe ubuntu-security
[01:14] &lt;tomreyn&gt; it's not an apport generated bug report
[01:15] &lt;tomreyn&gt; i just subscribed the ubuntu security team
[01:15] &lt;tomreyn&gt; https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-security
[01:17] &lt;sarnold&gt; aha, thanks
[01:17] &lt;tomreyn&gt; the 'errors' software is managed by https://launchpad.net/~daisy-pluckers - three busy people whom i assumed to have received a copy of my report (but maybe they did not because it is flagged security?)
[01:17] &lt;tomreyn&gt; i also e-mailed them and the apparent (based on the topic here) security team handler on duty about it
[01:18] &lt;sarnold&gt; probably just brian, hehe
[01:20] &lt;sarnold&gt; tomreyn: thanks for the ping :)
[01:20] &lt;tomreyn&gt; so.. i suggest discussing internally how to ensure that private security bugs reported against (somewhat) important infrastructural software are received by someone who is able to act upon them
[01:20] &lt;tomreyn&gt; i'm sorry this boring bug ended up in your hands :)
[01:21] &lt;tomreyn&gt; and i appreciate your response.
[01:23] &lt;sarnold&gt; yeah, reporting to *one* person is a bit weaksauce
[01:25] &lt;tomreyn&gt; since brian is not a member of the security team i'm not even sure he received it
[01:26] &lt;sarnold&gt; I think he probably did -- at least I subscribe other folks to bugs all the time :)
[01:40] &lt;tomreyn&gt; very well. (but, yes, more recipients might be better.)
[01:42] &lt;sarnold&gt; definitely

[02:50]  * tsimonq2 throws on a $dayjob hat
[02:50] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; So, something regressed in PHP 8.1 in Jammy, as the result of a security update.
[02:50] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I'll give it a day or so before I go file a regression-update bug.
[02:50] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; That being said, is_file() is completely broken, and I have anecdotal evidence confirming.
[02:50] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Is *anyone* else experiencing issues with PHP 8.1?

[16:06] &lt;bdmurray&gt; "Weird stuff"
[16:09] &lt;slyon&gt; danilogondolfo: see enr0n's status about the apparmor namespace issue. I guess that's what we see in Netplan, too?
[16:09] &lt;schopin&gt; why is netplan using unshare() ? oO
[16:10] &lt;slyon&gt; unshare? oO I didn't check the details yet, but we're seeing strange autopkgtest failures related to namespace restrictions, that cannot be reproduced in Debian
[16:11] &lt;schopin&gt; that'd be the syscall to create new namespaces :)
[16:12] &lt;juliank&gt; We ready to continue?
[16:12] &lt;slyon&gt; oh right. We're not creating any namespaces manually... But it was ringing a bell in my head when I saw that context :)
[16:12] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; the issue we are seeing seems to not be related to that I guess. It's due to /usr/lib/netplan being deleted and not recreated due upgrade as far as I can see

[16:15] &lt;slyon&gt; enr0n: I don't think it's visible from the public logs. Danilo had to dig into a local VM to extract some logs. But it might be unrelated after all..

[16:15] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 1969394 is with desktop still I believe and not actionable

[16:16] &lt;juliank&gt; I don't think that's even possible?
[16:17] &lt;bdmurray&gt; That's my memory
[16:17] &lt;juliank&gt; Wayland doesn't support things like that by design for security reasons
[16:17] &lt;bdrung&gt; juliank, is there no way to map a window to a program name?
[16:17] &lt;juliank&gt; You can't get a list of windows even I believe
[16:17] &lt;enr0n&gt; I thought we did an SRU for this a year or two ago
[16:18] &lt;bdrung&gt; The use case: A user knows the icon and window title, but not the program name
[16:18] &lt;enr0n&gt; This looks like a duplicate of bug 1952947
[16:18] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 1952947 in apport (Ubuntu Jammy) "ubuntu-bug -w (using xprop) doesn't work under wayland" [Medium, Fix Released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1952947
[16:18] &lt;juliank&gt; Well
[16:19] &lt;schopin&gt; There's no DE-agnostic way, but maybe we can figure out an API for Gnome and KDE?
[16:19] &lt;bdmurray&gt; "The patch for this bug adds a message explaining that the -w,--window option cannot be used on Wayland, and suggests a method for finding the window's PID instead."
[16:19] &lt;bdrung&gt; Yes, but the problem is that user do not know the application name.
[16:20] &lt;waveform&gt; how does firefox manage it (as a Wayland application, and something that lists "what window do you want to share?")
[16:20] &lt;schopin&gt; FWIW xdg-portal has a way to list windows when trying to do screenshots/screencast.
[16:20] &lt;waveform&gt; ah
[16:20] &lt;juliank&gt; it might not be possible to get back to the pid from that
[16:20] &lt;schopin&gt; However reading the doc I didn't see a way to get from the handle to a PID or anything like that.

[16:21] &lt;juliank&gt; if you can get the .desktop that is enough though
[16:21] &lt;juliank&gt; But we can discuss this more and find out ways or someone on the bug tells us before comitting this to jira

[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; oh wow
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; three new
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gsasl/+bug/2044535 actually is only shown as it is up in the task list
[15:40] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2044535 in libgssglue (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libgssglue" [Undecided, New]
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the request is for libgssglue Edit
[15:40] &lt;slyon&gt; this seems to be a false positive
[15:40] &lt;slyon&gt; It's assigned to security
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we need to mark this something else than New
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; doing so
[15:41] &lt;slyon&gt; Is it due to the unassigned gsasl task?
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes
[15:41] &lt;slyon&gt; Could probably be Invalid.
[15:41] &lt;slyon&gt; It was just to make it show up on foundations reports
[15:41] &lt;slyon&gt; I can handle that
[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I've already updated

[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, either way
[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this needs reviewers
[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; anyone up to take one this week?

[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; until the mid cycle spint I'm not sure I can handle one easily
[15:46] &lt;eslerm&gt; (I just set pydantic to incomplete for jamepage 's review)
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; didrocks: mentioned he has a conflict usually now but is ok to pick one if highlighted, I'll do so and if impossible let me know and I'll try to squeeze it in ignoring the planning
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks eslerm
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, next agenda item

[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; python-cssselect we mentioned before as well
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and the dmarc related things are from mirespace
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; there was one update in one of those ...

[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok still on her
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: that one is good
[15:47] &lt;eslerm&gt; pydantic has security ack already, but upstream brought up a concern afterwards
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that was there for a potential MIr
[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but fixed in cherrypy3 last few days
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: oh is that what happened, reading ...
[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; jamespage: I think the pydantic question is for you to answer that is from the openstack deps
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; will this change to v2 to not be stuck?
[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; I'm not sure what stuck means, debian hasn't updated to v2 yet
[15:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; the pydantic in debian seems unhappy https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1058324 and the v2 uses rust https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1052619 -- there may not be an easy path forward
[15:49] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Debian bug 1058324 in src:pydantic "pydantic: FTBFS: failed tests" [Serious, Open]
[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/tags
[15:49] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Debian bug 1052619 in wnpp "ITP: pydantic-core -- Rust implementation of pydantic core functionality" [Wishlist, Open]
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; there are really many 2.x updates but only minimal fix updates on 1.x
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: and they have no namespacing calling it pydantic2 to be co-installable or any such?
[15:51] &lt;eslerm&gt; I'm not aware of that
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hrm
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, incomplete is right for james and the team to answer how they want to deal with that
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it can be 1.x now, but we'd need a commitment to make it 2.x to maintain it in the long run - is that the correct state eslerm?
[15:51] &lt;eslerm&gt; that feels appropriate to me
[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: would you require 2.x in noble or any time later?
[15:52] &lt;eslerm&gt; likely, Seth?
[15:52] &lt;eslerm&gt; security support in LTS would be much better with 2.x
[15:52] &lt;jamespage&gt; I don't think that's under debate and I did comment on this - it just quite a wide set of packages to test and update to bump to 2 right now
[15:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; I'm not sure "require" is quite the right word; the timing is pretty poor :(
[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; indeed
[15:52] &lt;eslerm&gt; +1
[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; reading more of the backlog
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we even discussed that
[15:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; a change of this magnitude would be nice to do *before* an LTS release; I could easily imagine the upstream folks moving on to a hypothetical 2.1 and 2.2 etc in quick order, as they keep making progress...
[15:53] &lt;jamespage&gt; we did
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and I should remember as I posted in november
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; "- not going to 2.x for now, thanks for explaining"
[15:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; hah, nice
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, so this can go back to in-progress
[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; was worth to make sure
[15:53] &lt;eslerm&gt; upstreams comment was: "Just to confirm, I assume it will be pydantic V2 that's added to Ubuntu main?! It would be very unfortunate if an old and outdated version was added."
[15:54] &lt;sarnold&gt; old, outdated, and hopefuilly stable :)
[15:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we will add v1 to main now and update it in the future to v2
[15:54] &lt;eslerm&gt; sounds good to me
[15:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; oh wow

[16:02] &lt;teward&gt; *burps loudly on entry*
[16:02] &lt;seb128&gt; hey, I'm off work today (covid) but will be around to try to vote if I'm needed to have a quorum
[16:03] &lt;teward&gt; seb128: you might be, i'm abstaining on any vote on arraybolt unless *I* am needed because otherwise there's bias in my vote.
[16:03] &lt;teward&gt; :P
[16:04] &lt;teward&gt; without you and I we aren't quorate though
[16:04] &lt;teward&gt; though we aren't quorate anyways
[16:04] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; two does not a quorum make :P
[16:04] &lt;teward&gt; need 4 to be quorate, and there are 0 voting members of the DMB present it seems
[16:04] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I'm here but in another meeting
[16:04] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I've heard sil_2100 is out
[16:05] &lt;rbasak&gt; Ah sorry o/
[16:05] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Whew. :)
[16:06] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I already have my Wiki page and introduction note prepped, so I should be able to move forward quickly once we start.
[16:07] &lt;rbasak&gt; Sorry I hope to be more available in a few minutes
[16:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; Am I the only voting person who will actually be here then?
[16:12] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; :shrug: grill now and vote later I guess?
[16:12] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I'm able to vote although I'm in another meeting
[16:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; Well I quite strongly request IRC meetings, so I guess I should ask the questions rather than defer then.
[16:13] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Does anyone actually mind if teward votes? I trust he's not going to risk the safety of the archive to make me happy, and I'm guessing he has questions ready.
[16:13] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I think he *should* vote, because I don't see a single package on your list that he's sponsored. ;P
[16:13] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; but in any event, if the vote happens later that's not an issue
[16:13] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I don't mind.
[16:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; I know of no specific reason he shouldn't.
[16:15] &lt;seb128&gt; I'm fine with him voting
[16:17] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; (#startmeeting? :))
[16:18]  * arraybolt3 waits for teward to emerge back from the black hole he appears to have vanished into
[16:18] &lt;teward&gt; i have a flurry of C-level execs calling me right now unexpectedly
[16:19] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; well tell them all to wait a sec! :P /s
[16:19] &lt;teward&gt; *throws arraybolt3 out the airlock*
[16:19] &lt;teward&gt; i can vote, but we need quorum
[16:19] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; teward: we have quorum
[16:19] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; teward: We *have* quorum.
[16:19] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; there's four people here.
[16:19] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; you, seb128, rbasak, and bdmurray
[16:19] &lt;teward&gt; bd, robie, me, and seb (if seb's alive) count
[16:19] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; and there's only seven people on the board
[16:20] &lt;teward&gt; i'm aware, but i'm just making that point that I don't know if seb is still around, but i can see he is
[16:20] &lt;teward&gt; i'm alive and we have quorum so
[16:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; Sorry for my slowness. I'm a bit thrown by this being the first week after the break.
[16:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; I would like to be more prepared, but I'm not.
[16:20] &lt;teward&gt; rbasak: welcome to my world.  *slides a coffee*
[16:20] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; Seriously? &lt;seb128&gt; hey, I'm off work today (covid) but will be around to try to vote if I'm needed to have a quorum
[16:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; But I think I should still do this now, since you're owed that.
[16:20] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; DMB is an Ubuntu function, not a Canonical function.
[16:20] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; rbasak: Understandable, thanks for clarifying. :)
[16:21] &lt;teward&gt; Eickmeyer: you can cut that line of thinking/discussion right there
[16:21] &lt;teward&gt; and i say that with the CC hat on :\
[16:21] &lt;teward&gt; (stop opening random cans of worms unless you want me as an enemy)
[16:21] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Okay, let's *NOT* do this now, and actually start the meeting, please.
[16:22] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; I was just saying that because he said he's here.
[16:22] &lt;teward&gt; i can't chair from my phone sanely, who's gonna chair
[16:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; I can, but I'm also reviewing the application as fast as I can.
[16:23] &lt;teward&gt; someone send me the link again for it?

[16:26] &lt;rbasak&gt; Welcome arraybolt3!
[16:26] &lt;rbasak&gt; Your contribution history looks impressive. Thank you!
[16:26] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; o/ Thanks :)
[16:27] &lt;rbasak&gt; I will have questions shortly
[16:27] &lt;rbasak&gt; Anyone else, feel free
[16:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; arraybolt3: let's say that you're about to upload a package merge from Debian and it's a couple of days before feature freeze. How would you check, technically, that you're not about to inadvertently trigger a large transition?
[16:29] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Probably my first step is to look at the reverse depends with apt-cache rdepends.
[16:29] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; after that, if there were some reverse depends, I check those reverse depends and so on.
[16:29] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Usually shared libraries are at higher risk of causing these sorts of things than applications.
[16:30] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (shared libraries including things like Python libraries, not necessarily libwhatever1 packages)
[16:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; What would you be looking at in the rdepends list?
[16:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; s/at/for/
[16:30] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; mainly to see how big the network of rdepends is. One or two might not be a huge deal depending on what those one or two are...
[16:31] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; ...but if there's a large network of them then I know to exercise caution and potentially not attempt the process at all.
[16:31] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I could also check the update excuses page to see if packages that were rdepends were already part of transitions.
[16:31] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Since entangling those could block other transitions and cause Big Problems.
[16:31] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (the page I'm referring to is https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html)
[16:32] &lt;rbasak&gt; Could you explain to me what you understand a transition to be exactly, please?
[16:32]  * arraybolt3 opens the Proposed Migration page...
[16:33] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; A transition is when a package migrates from -proposed to -release after Britney and autopkgtest verifies that this won't break anything.
[16:34] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (won't break anything = passes all five points at the top of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration)
[16:34] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think you're describing proposed migration as opposed to a transition
[16:35] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; for some reason I didn't realize there was a difference, we call it a "python3 transition" when the python3-default package is uploaded.
[16:36] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; since that triggers a whole web of autopkgtests and if any of those fail, then the package is blocked and the failures need to be fixed before the transition can migrate
[16:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; It's true that a transition should hold up proposed migration until it is complete, so the two concepts are very closely linked.
[16:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; And you're right that autopkgtest failures hold up proposed migrations
[16:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; ie. there are multiple things that hold up proposed migration, and one of those is that there's a transition in progress
[16:38] &lt;rbasak&gt; It's possible that you understand what I'm looking for and we're just getting stuck in terminology
[16:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let's say that src:foo 1.0 is in the archive, and it produces binary packages libfoo1 which various packages depend on, and libfoo-dev which those packages build depend on.
[16:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; What are the implications of uploading src:foo 2.0, which moves on to libfoo2?
[16:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; In relation to proposed migration?
[16:40] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; API breaking changes which would very likely cause autopkgtest failures due to the need for the entangled packages to be updated to use the new API.
[16:40] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; in which case you end up with multiple interrelated packages migrating together once everything passes the proposed migration tests.
[16:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let's pretend that there are no autopkgtests in any of the relevant packages, so nothing is held up by autopkgtest failures
[16:41] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (er, sorry, I mean reverse dependencies when I say entangled packages)
[16:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; Why would proposed migration be held up?
[16:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; Why would proposed migration _still_ be held up?
[16:41] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Lots of possible reasons: it could no longer build and publish on an architecture it used to...
[16:42] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; ...there could be dependency issues that would result in unsatisfied dependencies if the package(s) migrate...
[16:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; What dependency issues exactly?
[16:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; My example is the common case of a completely routine transition, so my expectation is that you should be able to follow and give me the specific dependency issue that would hold things up
[16:43] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Anything that would cause apt to be unable to install the package were it in the archive, i.e. a dependency is missing or the proper version isn't available because (for instance) one of the reverse depends isn't updated to use the new version of the library.
[16:43] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; so for a concrete example:
[16:43] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; src:libfoo 1.0 exists, and package bar 1.0 depends on it.
[16:43] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; libfoo2 is uploaded.
[16:44] &lt;rbasak&gt; package bar 1.0 depends on what exactly?
[16:44] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; bar 1.0 depends on libfoo1.
[16:44] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; hold on, I'm getting slightly mixed up
[16:45] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; so src:libfoo 1.0 is uploaded, bar 1.0 is uploaded which has a Depends: libfoo1 (= 1.0), then src:libfoo 2.0 is uploaded.
[16:46] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; now bar 1.0 can no longer satisfy its dependency, so bar 2.0 has to be uploaded also before they can migrate together.
[16:47] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK I think you have enough of an understanding there. Though note that a straight rebuild of bar 1.0 might be sufficient, since it's the ABI that changed, and it's possible that the API remains the same or that bar uses a small enough subset that it works without changes against foo 2.
[16:47] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; True.
[16:47] &lt;rbasak&gt; So, going back a few steps, what exactly would you be looking for to see if you're going to inadvertently trigger this kind of situation?
[16:48] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; ah, I get it better now. Soname bumps mainly, but also versioned Depends since it's not just shared objects that can cause transitions.
[16:48] &lt;rbasak&gt; At least in the common case. I realise an exhaustive search is difficult, but what are the most common indicators?
[16:48] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; so if I build libfoo and end up with libfoo2 when I had libfoo1, that's a red flag.
[16:48] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. Thanks!
[16:49] &lt;rbasak&gt; My next question was going to be about proposed migration but I think you've covered that enough already :)
[16:49] &lt;rbasak&gt; Next question: when is feature freeze for Noble, where would I look up that information, and who can authorise an exception and where is that process documented?
[16:50] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; The page where the freezes are documented for Noble is at https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-schedule/35649. According to that calendar, Feature Freeze is February 29, 2024.
[16:51] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; The freeze exception process is documented at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FreezeExceptionProcess.
[16:51] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; the Release Team are the ones who can ACK an FFe.
[16:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let's say that you'd like to upload new upstream release of foo 1.2.2, and 1.2.1 is currently in the archive, and it's March 1st. Is that acceptable? Or if that's not enough information, what extra information do you need to make a decision?
[16:53] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Not enough information - what versioning scheme does foo 1.2.2 use? Is is a purely bugfix release? Or could it incorporate new features or breaking changes?
[16:54] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Assuming it uses semver, an upload of 1.2.2 is *probably* OK since 1.2.1 -&gt; 1.2.2 is a patch release.
[16:55] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (I say probably since upstream might not strictly adhere to the rule of only making backwards-compatible bug fixes in a patch release, if they do make breaking API changes that's still a no-no)
[16:55] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (or if they introduce new API at all)
[16:56] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; if for some reason the patch release is really important and isn't suitable for introduction after Feature Freeze, then I would either backport the parts of the release that are Feature Freeze compatible that I need, or request an FFe if necessary. That would have to be decided on a case-by-case basis.
[16:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. Thanks!
[16:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm just looking at your "regular" SRU history

[16:05] &lt;bdmurray&gt; bdrung: Are these bug patterns you've committed or are you using them locally?
[16:06] &lt;bdrung&gt; bdmurray, most of the news ones were just locally. I did not pushlish those bug pattern where I do not expect new reports in the future.
[16:06] &lt;bdmurray&gt; that makes sense to me
[16:07] &lt;slyon&gt; enr0n: new systemd changed the generator paths to move to /usr/lib, right?
[16:08] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; yes, I've got into this problem hehe
[16:08] &lt;slyon&gt; I see netplan FTBFS in unstable and noble. But I guess that's actually a good thing, so we can move away from /lib
[16:08] &lt;enr0n&gt; slyon: yes I believe so
[16:09] &lt;vorlon&gt; Ubuntu has been "usr merged" for several cycles; as long as your files don't go missing on upgrade due to the /lib -&gt; /usr/lib move, it's fine to use the new path
[16:09] &lt;vorlon&gt; there's discussion on debian-devel about some of the pitfalls, mostly to do with Replaces: between packages at the same time as paths change
[16:10] &lt;slyon&gt; ACK. I think for Netplan it's not too special. We've been shipping the generator in /lib/ for legacy reasons, but I think the move should be pretty simple
[16:12] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Skia: What happened upstream with klibc?
[16:13] &lt;Skia&gt; nothing yet, the MR I uploaded to noble is still not merged: https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/klibc/-/merge_requests/12
[16:13] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Merge 12 in kernel-team/klibc "d/i/h/klibc-utils: Fix compatibility issue with busybox and improve verbose debug output." [Opened]
[16:15] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Oh, debian modified coreutils ... got it
[16:15] &lt;Skia&gt; what happened instead is that Debian reverted upstream's behavior change in coreutils, so that cp and mv don't start breaking all the scripts of the world, and added a deprecation warning that upstream forgot
[16:16] &lt;Skia&gt; but I also red that they still need to fix broken cp/mv usage in packages, and that should include klibc
[16:16] &lt;adrien&gt; the change in coreutils is not new anymore by now though
[16:17] &lt;Skia&gt; according to the discussions upstream, it's not new, but it's not widely shipped by distributions either, so in a sense, it's quite new
[16:17] &lt;bdrung&gt; enough time to read the reports. moving on.

[16:18] &lt;Skia&gt; correct
[16:19] &lt;bdrung&gt; that update-manager bug is about UI changes and therefore belongs to the desktop team

[16:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; that one should be taken for noble, but there's no action for Foundations at the moment because there's a dependency on changes to livepatch to expose the necessary information about whether a reboot is required
[16:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; I think we should go ahead and target this

[16:38] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-secretstorage, IRC logs say cpete was touching this one as well?
[16:38] &lt;vorlon&gt; at least the vorta autopkgtest part
[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; let's pass that one to adrien
[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-secretstorage: adrien
[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; there's also an MIR issue in there too fwiw
[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; Component mismatch entries
[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; python3-secretstorage/amd64 in main cannot depend on python3-jeepney in universe
[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; s390-tools, let's see if this is waiting for an AA
[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; it is
[16:40] &lt;slyon&gt; hmm.. jeepney rings a bell
[16:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; I'll take that (s390-tools + s390-tools-signed)
[16:41] &lt;slyon&gt; (but I can't find context, currently)
[16:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; boost1.74
[16:41] &lt;slyon&gt; It might have been a MIR candidate in the past.
[16:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; "only" stuck for 16 days, so we haven't looked at this yet :)
[16:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; doko uploaded it but it was a no-change rebuild
[16:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; bdrung: can you take this?
[16:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; brltty blocks on liblouis, which is desktop's
[16:43] &lt;bdrung&gt; i would prefer to follow up on pycryptodome (to help the python migration)
[16:43] &lt;vorlon&gt; dpkg was my upload, but the sbuild autopkgtest behavior is knotty
[16:43] &lt;vorlon&gt; dbungert: can you have a look at dpkg vs sbuild?
[16:43] &lt;dbungert&gt; vorlon: ack
[16:43] &lt;vorlon&gt; libtirpc vs glibc: danilogondolfo ?
[16:43] &lt;danilogondolfo&gt; vorlon, ack
[16:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; socat: xypron?
[16:44] &lt;xypron&gt; ok
[16:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-werkzeug: slyon?
[16:44] &lt;slyon&gt; ok
[16:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-apt, I'm assuming juliank is on this one also
[16:45] &lt;vorlon&gt; cmake: mkukri?
[16:45] &lt;mkukri&gt; ack
[16:45] &lt;vorlon&gt; debconf: enr0n?
[16:45] &lt;enr0n&gt; vorlon: ack
[16:45] &lt;vorlon&gt; I'll take acl
[16:45] &lt;vorlon&gt; netplan.io vs wpa: ogayot?
[16:45] &lt;ogayot&gt; vorlon: ack
[16:46] &lt;slyon&gt; ^ probably just flaky
[16:46] &lt;vorlon&gt; fwiw if someone figures out the glibc stuff on debconf or libtirpc, maybe it also applies to binutils
[16:46] &lt;vorlon&gt; not going to assign binutils at the moment though
[16:46] &lt;vorlon&gt; btrfs-progs is i386 dep-wait, I'll take that
[16:46] &lt;vorlon&gt; and that's the list
[16:46] &lt;vorlon&gt; bdrung:
[16:47] &lt;bdrung&gt; i looked at boost1.74. the fist test failure is a dependency issue and i probably just have to retry the test.

# UBUNTU-MEETING

[14:45] &lt;lunazest&gt; any MIR meeting today or are Canonical people still on vacation?
[15:29] &lt;sarnold&gt; good morning
[15:29] &lt;eslerm&gt; good morning
[15:30] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hiho
[15:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status
[15:31] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 15:31:12 UTC.  The chair is cpaelzer.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology
[15:31] &lt;meetingology&gt; Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick
[15:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Ping for MIR meeting - didrocks joalif slyon sarnold cpaelzer jamespage ( eslerm dviererbe )
[15:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; let us check who of us is already back
[15:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I've seen sarnold and eslerm before the meeting log started  hi
[15:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; IIRC slyon is still out
[15:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so it might be lonely, but still worth to have a look in case something huge came up
[15:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic current component mismatches

[15:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I've already filed an issues for cherrypy3 in server
[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cherrypy3/+bug/2047821
[15:33] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2047821 in objgraph (Ubuntu) "[MIR] objgraph" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and I did an analysis for https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nut/+bug/2046263
[15:33] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2046263 in libmodbus (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libmodbus" [Undecided, Incomplete]
[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think both are bad and we should not promote them
[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; details in the cases and the team needs to follow up
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we see a few other new cases
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; two I think
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; lxml -&gt; pytohn-cssselect (foundations) and duplicity -&gt; setuptools-scm
[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think the former casn wait a week until slyon is here
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; doko: ^^ in case you want to raise this in the team this week already
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; jbicha: seb128: didrocks: FYI on the duplicity case
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; let us know by next week once you had a chance to look
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and then there is a secret which changed in those views
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: eslerm: do you spot it?
[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hint: something is missing
[15:36] &lt;sarnold&gt; they did look rather smaller than I remembered but I couldn't figure out what was gone :)
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; maas -&gt; ipmitools is gone after Dimitri and Adam and I sorted that out
[15:36] &lt;sarnold&gt; there's much less perl around ..
[15:36] &lt;sarnold&gt; OMG OMG OMG
[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hehe
[15:36] &lt;eslerm&gt; what is the new group they are in?
[15:37] &lt;sarnold&gt; our christmas wishes did come true!
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; they are in the maas-community seed which has other things they use but are only on community level of support
[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; which is true for ipmitools as well, and in future also isc-dhcp-server which got demoted (we moved that as well)
[15:37] &lt;eslerm&gt; that is a good place for them :)
[15:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; enough happiness, let us look at a potentially huge queue without many people to process it
[15:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic New MIRs
[15:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Mission: ensure to assign all incoming reviews for fast processing

[15:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think I can only pick one which is our promised minimal rate (1 per MIR reviewer per week)
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'll pick the oldest for fairness
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; didrocks: slyon: joalif: if you read that later, please consider picking one from the list as well
[15:39] &lt;jamespage&gt; looking
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; or we get into bad backlog mode
[15:39] &lt;jamespage&gt; I can pick https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-pyasyncore/+bug/2046160
[15:39] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2046160 in python-pyasyncore (Ubuntu) "[MIR] python3-pyasyncore" [Undecided, New]
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'll pick  python3-pyasyncore
[15:39] &lt;eslerm&gt; libqrtr-glib might be worth checking today too, it looks fairly complete ?
[15:39] &lt;jamespage&gt; hah
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; you shouldn't do your own jamespage :-)
[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; at least if avoidable
[15:40] &lt;jamespage&gt; yeah just saw who raised that
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah libqrtr-glib seems just a confirmation if we are complete
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I can do that
[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; jamespage: which of the remaining ones do you want to pick?
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; by age it would be https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libparams-validate-perl/+bug/2046181
[15:42] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2046181 in libparams-validate-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libparams-validate-perl (as libgetopt-long-descriptive-perl, libmail-dkim-perl dependency)" [Undecided, New]
[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok with that?
[15:42] &lt;jamespage&gt; sure

[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I guess not much as well, or was security not allowed to take a timeout as the CVEs do not stop either?
[15:44] &lt;sarnold&gt; we worked short hours with skeleton crews, no MIRs were worked
[15:44] &lt;eslerm&gt; pydantic has a draft review done :)
[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: understandable
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: lovely
[15:45] &lt;sarnold&gt; iirc libmysofa had some communication with upstream via private email infrastructure that worked better than via canonical email infrastructure
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; which is the last to get jaraco out of the picture
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: yeah you mentioned there were issues, still odd
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; well, that is more than I could expect given most were out
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thank you two!
[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic Any other business?
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; nothing from me in 2024 yet, except - Happy new year everyone!
[15:46] &lt;sarnold&gt; happy new year :) that's it from me, hehe
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; wow - in sync!
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; in that case, let us not prolong it much more
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; except, well
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; lunazest: you pinged before
[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; did you have any question to ask or clarification to make?
[15:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; my guess is no: luna likes to follow along with the various meetings equally
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hmm, not around
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; which I'm happy to hear
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but then we do not need to wait
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; clsoing out for today
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thank you all
[15:50] &lt;lunazest&gt; cpaelzer: nope not really started watching Youtube and forgot about the meeting sorry
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hehe
[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok lunazest

[20:00] &lt;sil2100&gt; No worries! Should I chair today perhaps?
[20:00] &lt;sil2100&gt; Been a while
[20:00] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; Yes please thanks
[20:00] &lt;vorlon&gt; here, but I'm going to be slow at typing today for a minute as well; just got back from a walk in the rain and my hands are stiff :-)
[20:00] &lt;sil2100&gt; #startmeeting Ubuntu Technical Board
[20:00] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 20:00:33 UTC.  The chair is sil2100.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology

[20:00] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic Apologies
[20:00] &lt;sil2100&gt; I guess seb is out, right?
[20:01] &lt;amurray&gt; he doesn't appear to be online from what I can see
[20:01] &lt;sil2100&gt; I can't remember if he sent anything, but I think he's still out-of-office
[20:01] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic Action review
[20:01] &lt;sil2100&gt; ACTION: seb128/amurray/sil200 to help drafting the snap-store Ubuntu-specific tracks usage
[20:02] &lt;sil2100&gt; Not sure about seb or amurray, but I didn't work on this yet
[20:02] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; My actions all need carrying over please.
[20:02] &lt;amurray&gt; I recall seeing some update to the doc but I need to look at it again - carry over please
[20:02] &lt;sil2100&gt; Hopefully I can contribute more in the nearest month
[20:02] &lt;sil2100&gt; ACK
[20:03] &lt;vorlon&gt; (confirmed that Seb is OoO)
[20:03] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action seb128/amurray/sil2100 to help drafting the snap-store Ubuntu-specific tracks usage
[20:03] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: seb128/amurray/sil2100 to help drafting the snap-store Ubuntu-specific tracks usage
[20:03] &lt;vorlon&gt; my action is also carry-over
[20:03] &lt;sil2100&gt; Now some actions from rbasak-mobile, carrying-over as requested
[20:03] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action rbasak to draft a proposal of the DMB-proposed inactivity expiration policy for TB ratification
[20:03] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: rbasak to draft a proposal of the DMB-proposed inactivity expiration policy for TB ratification
[20:03] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action rbasak to follow up on finding consensus on question of test plans for third party apps
[20:03] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: rbasak to follow up on finding consensus on question of test plans for third party apps
[20:04] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action rbasak to open wider discussion on third-party repo policy
[20:04] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: rbasak to open wider discussion on third-party repo policy
[20:04] &lt;sil2100&gt; Next is:
[20:04] &lt;sil2100&gt; CTION: seb128 to continue working with SRU, AA, Release, Backporters and Security teams to document their membership process and link to it from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoard#Team_Delegations
[20:04] &lt;sil2100&gt; I guess best would be if we had seb here
[20:05] &lt;sil2100&gt; I am certainly still responsible for the Release team documentation. As the release team knows, I have a short draft that I need to make public somewhere
[20:05] &lt;sil2100&gt; I'll discuss with the release team on the best placement for that
[20:05] &lt;sil2100&gt; Anything to add before I carry it over?
[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; no; I think it's clearly carry-over
[20:05] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action seb128 to continue working with SRU, AA, Release, Backporters and Security teams to document their membership process and link to it from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoard#Team_Delegations
[20:05] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: seb128 to continue working with SRU, AA, Release, Backporters and Security teams to document their membership process and link to it from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoard#Team_Delegations
[20:06] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; I think the SRU side is done on the ML and just meeds transferring to formal docs
[20:06] &lt;sil2100&gt; Some carry overs:
[20:06] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action vorlon to write up draft guidelines for packages in the archive that download from the Internet
[20:06] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: vorlon to write up draft guidelines for packages in the archive that download from the Internet
[20:06] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu cinnamon on 24.04 request
[20:06] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu cinnamon on 24.04 request
[20:06] &lt;sil2100&gt; Now an action for me, but I think it's actually done:
[20:06] &lt;sil2100&gt; ACTION: sil2100 to follow-up with ubuntu studio on 24.04 request
[20:07] &lt;sil2100&gt; In my latest reply to the LTS qualification, I signed off it with my TB hat
[20:07] &lt;sil2100&gt; So I consider this one done
[20:08] &lt;sil2100&gt; (no carry over)
[20:08] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I have Lubuntu's draft LTS qualification on my desk and ready for a final ack today. Expect that soon.
[20:08] &lt;sil2100&gt; ACTION: amurray to follow-up with edubuntu on 24.04 request
[20:08] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray: how's your item looking? ^
[20:08] &lt;sil2100&gt; tsimonq2: excellent
[20:09] &lt;amurray&gt; I was waiting on them posting the support policy in some public location but I don't think they have anything (are apparently waiting on IS for their web hosting iirc)
[20:09] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; amurray: Hi! As far as I was aware, that wasn't a hard requirement.
[20:09] &lt;vorlon&gt; sil2100: you're signing off as an individual TB member?  I think it's better governance-wise to have TB votes on these, as in the example of ubuntu-unity
[20:10] &lt;sil2100&gt; vorlon: oh, I was not aware that was the process
[20:10] &lt;vorlon&gt; well the wiki page says "TB" not "a member of the TB"
[20:10] &lt;sil2100&gt; vorlon: I thought in the past I saw it being single people signing off
[20:10] &lt;sil2100&gt; Then we can vote for that for sure
[20:11] &lt;sil2100&gt; #vote Signing off on Ubuntu Studio on 24.04 LTS request
[20:11] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Signing off on Ubuntu Studio on 24.04 LTS request

[20:12] &lt;vorlon&gt; addendum: we ought to make sure we have some central place collecting the state of LTS sign-off for all the flavors

[20:12] &lt;meetingology&gt; Voting ended on: Signing off on Ubuntu Studio on 24.04 LTS request
[20:12] &lt;meetingology&gt; Votes for: 4, Votes against: 0, Abstentions: 0
[20:12] &lt;meetingology&gt; Motion carried
[20:12] &lt;sil2100&gt; vorlon: +1 on that too!
[20:12] &lt;sil2100&gt; For now I'll follow up on the thread, let me add an action for that
[20:13] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action sil2100 to send confirmation of successful LTS status for Ubuntu Studio 24.04
[20:13] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: sil2100 to send confirmation of successful LTS status for Ubuntu Studio 24.04
[20:13] &lt;sil2100&gt; Back to the previous action item
[20:13] &lt;vorlon&gt; do we want it in the 24.04 release notes in the discourse, or do we want it in a wiki page?
[20:14] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; addendum&gt; There is an existing Discourse thread tracking information about 24.04 participation that also includes these details. I would suggest to the TB that they should manage a Discourse post with the official list.
[20:14] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray: do you consider this a hard requirement for the policy to be made available right now, or would you be happy for this happening later?
[20:14] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; #link https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/responses-needed-flavor-participation-for-24-04-lts/40075
[20:14] &lt;amurray&gt; no I don't consider it a hard policy but I think we would definitely want it before the release goes live
[20:14] &lt;amurray&gt; s/policy/requirement/
[20:15] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray: +1 indeed
[20:15] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray: if you're fine with the request otherwise, do you want to vote for it now?
[20:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; as long as the flavor commits to having it up by release time, regardless of domain hosting status
[20:16] &lt;sil2100&gt; Eickmeyer: ^ is that something you can commit to?
[20:16] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; That puts Edubuntu in a rough situation with our current hosting situation. We simply do *not* have a place to put it.
[20:16] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; It seems weird to be waiting just because of an issue with publication in a particular place. I suggest just using Discourse in the meantime and so whether it is blocking or not shouldn't even need to be a question.
[20:16] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; We're working with Aaron Prisk to get IS to work on this, but they don't have it as a priority item.
[20:17] &lt;sil2100&gt; So maybe like this: if by around release time the hosting situation is still not solved, would it be possible for you to publish a discourse post with all the details instead?
[20:17] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; sil2100: It will be in the release notes for sure if the hosting situation isn't resolved. Our release notes have been published to Discourse in the meantime.
[20:17] &lt;vorlon&gt; NB hosting of per-flavor websites is not listed on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecognizedFlavors as part of what Canonical commits to
[20:18] &lt;sil2100&gt; Eickmeyer: that sounds like a good plan B to me
[20:18] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray WDYT?
[20:18] &lt;amurray&gt; works for me
[20:18] &lt;sil2100&gt; Let's vote
[20:18] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; vorlon: Edubuntu used to be hosted by Canonical, and Ubuntu Studio currently is, along with Kubuntu, so there's precident.
[20:19] &lt;sil2100&gt; #vote Signing off on Edubuntu 24.04 LTS request
[20:19] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Signing off on Edubuntu 24.04 LTS request
[20:19] &lt;meetingology&gt; Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')
[20:19] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; No precedent for an SLA though. I didn't think hosting at all or not was in question?
[20:19] &lt;sil2100&gt; +1 (with the compromise as we discussed above)
[20:19] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 (with the compromise as we discussed above) received from sil2100
[20:19] &lt;amurray&gt; +1
[20:19] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from amurray
[20:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; the point is that from a governance perspective, the flavors are responsible for meeting the LTS requirements, and this isn't a buck that can be passed to Canonical IS
[20:21] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; There's already a workaround in place, there's no buck being passed that I can see.
[20:21] &lt;sil2100&gt; (vorlon, rbasak-mobile ^)
[20:22] &lt;vorlon&gt; +1
[20:22] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from vorlon
[20:22] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; +1 see ML thread - I'm merely choosing to follow sil2100 and vorlon here.

[20:23] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray: can you follow up with the final decision on the thread? Thank you!
[20:23] &lt;amurray&gt; yep
[20:23] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action amurray to send confirmation of successful LTS status for Edubuntu 24.04
[20:23] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: amurray to send confirmation of successful LTS status for Edubuntu 24.04
[20:23] &lt;sil2100&gt; Carrying over seb's item
[20:23] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu budgie on 24.04 request
[20:23] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu budgie on 24.04 request
[20:23] &lt;sil2100&gt; ACTION: amurray to follow-up with ubuntu kylin on 24.04 request
[20:24] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray: ^ any luck with Kylin? I might have missed any ML threads regarding this
[20:24] &lt;amurray&gt; I proposed voting via email yesterday
[20:24] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; rbasak-mobile: There is existing precedence for flavors to ask Canonical to host infrastructure, however, to my knowledge it's been a courtesy rather than a requirement. For example, our domain is hosted by Canonical, and if that goes down, that would certainly reflect poorly on our qualification efforts.
[20:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; since the UbuntuKylin vote has already been called on the mailing list I propose we continue it there rather than voting in the meeting
[20:25] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray: do you want to vote here instead?
[20:25] &lt;amurray&gt; I think email is fine
[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; ACK o/
[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; I'll carry it over then
[20:26] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; I agree but again this shouldn't be relevant or seen as blocking. We can be pragmatic and just publish somewhere else eg. Discourse. Not need for this to formally block anything.
[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action amurray to follow-up with ubuntu kylin on 24.04 request
[20:26] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: amurray to follow-up with ubuntu kylin on 24.04 request
[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Okay, let's move on
[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic Scan the mailing list archive for anything we missed
[20:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; note that there is also CFV on the mailing list for Ubuntu Unity
[20:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; which wasn't assigned to me in the TB meeting when they were being assigned because I wasn't able to attend, instead I just picked up the ones that hadn't been assigned
=== JanC_ is now known as JanC
[20:27] &lt;sil2100&gt; I'll try to follow up on those with votes then
[20:27] &lt;sil2100&gt; I think there are no actionable items on the ML that do not have actions already, from what I know?
[20:28] &lt;sil2100&gt; Since we have the participation e-mails, the process thread, and all those have action items assigned
[20:28] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; I think it's worth following up on a multitude of issues raised by the mutter regression but I'll follow up on the list first, hopefully this week.
[20:28] &lt;sil2100&gt; rbasak-mobile: thanks
[20:28] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic Check up on community bugs and techboard bugs'
[20:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; Nothing new there
[20:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic Select a chair for the next meeting
[20:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; That would be amurray, with rbasak-mobile as backup
[20:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; If that'
[20:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; I'm very confused by that
[20:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; If that's fine
[20:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; the wiki page said it was supposed to be seb128 with me as backup
[20:30] &lt;sil2100&gt; Well, amurray is next after me, right?
[20:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; are we just jumping the pointer?
[20:30] &lt;sil2100&gt; I have volunteered today as I have not chaired for quite a long time
[20:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; I don't mind, it's just not historical practice :)
[20:31] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic AOB
[20:31] &lt;amurray&gt; fwiw I think I am on leave during the next scheduled TB meeting so not sure if I will be able to make it at this time
[20:31] &lt;sil2100&gt; Ah, so maybe back to the scheduled chairs then? seb and vorlon as backup?
[20:32] &lt;sil2100&gt; If there are no objections, I'd propose that then
[20:32] &lt;sil2100&gt; Any other business?
[20:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; nothing else from me
[20:33] &lt;amurray&gt; nor from me
[20:34] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; Please don't wait on everyone to say no :-)
[20:35] &lt;sil2100&gt; ;)
