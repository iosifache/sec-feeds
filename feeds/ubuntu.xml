has tackled the obvious things\n[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the rest is "looking for volunteers" to tackle more\n[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; speak up if anyone wants to ... :-)\n[14:48] &lt;eslerm&gt; possibly, we could add that an owning teams director needs to request late MIRs\n[14:48] &lt;eslerm&gt; we had a last second libyuv request, which ended up not beeing needed after ack'd\n[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; there's a few cases to care for -- one with the "the team didn't plan" and then the "oh upstream or debian has walked away from package foo because they're switching to package bar"\n[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; i think our "you get to talk to the director of security engineering" is a decent speedbump to discourage the first one, but I wish we could come up with some clever ideas to spot the overlooked packages\n[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm happy with adding "bring high level for late requests"\n[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; bring wording in a PR for that for discussion please\n[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; for the other case let us brainstorm for 3 minutes ...\n[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; It plays into the "re-evaluate things in main" TBH\n[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; which we asked for but got denied for resourcing\n[14:51] &lt;eslerm&gt; that's not what I mean with #22\n[14:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; storm idea one, look for new Replaces: or maybe dropped Depends: from other packages?\n[14:52] &lt;eslerm&gt; it is for cases where there is ack for the MIR, but then owning team goes idle for a long period of time (say 2 years)\n[14:52] &lt;eslerm&gt; I am okay dropping issue though\n[14:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; storm idea two, look for new packages with small levenstein distances from packages already in main\n[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: I think we usually get signal by bugs, the cases I see crashing as where responsibility and ownership is unclear.\n[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: which does not mean I'd not like a scanner that provides extra signal\n[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: now I got you - like "what is the consequence if they make us busy and then walk away" ?\n[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: I'm not sure, but things change - so that can not always be prevented IMHO.\n[14:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: not sure if defining negative consequences would help, or did you have something completely different in mind?\n[14:54] &lt;eslerm&gt; mostly, this occured and then a package was added to main, and I believe it should have had a quick re-review first\n[14:54] &lt;eslerm&gt; it's not about negative consequences for us doing the work, just that more work is needed if a review has gone "stale"\n[14:55] &lt;slyon&gt; so adding something like a timeout on an ACK?\n[14:55] &lt;eslerm&gt; yes, I proposed 2 years\n[14:56] &lt;slyon&gt; sounds reasonable to me.\n[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm +1 on timeout on an Ack\n[14:56] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: that would be like our re-review idea, but only for things that didn't make it into "main" yet.\n[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; While we do not get a re-review, if it didn't make it into main it is fine to time out\n[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

Thanks!\n[16:03] &lt;teward&gt; unless Desktop has different requirements in their teams for upload to different segments and such\n[16:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; sil2100, kanashiro?\n[16:03] &lt;sil2100&gt; Sorry, was finishing up a meeting, now here 100%\n[16:03] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #startmeeting Developer Membership Board\n[16:03] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 16:03:57 UTC.  The chair is utkarsh2102.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology\n[16:03] &lt;sil2100&gt; Reading up the backlog\n[16:03] &lt;meetingology&gt; Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick\n[16:04] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DeveloperMembershipBoard/Agenda\n[16:04] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I'll head straight to the applications o/\n[16:04] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #topic Core Dev Applications\n[16:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #subtopic Amin Bandali\n[16:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/bandali/core-dev-application\n[16:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: hello! can you please introduce yourself?\n[16:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; meanwhile we all go through your application page?\n[16:05] &lt;bandali&gt; hi utkarsh2102 :) sure\n[16:07] &lt;bandali&gt; i'm Amin Bandali, and i've been part of Canonical's Ubuntu Desktop team since Nov 2022. i'm primarily the maintainer of Ubuntu's Firefox packages, but i also work on various other aspects of the Ubuntu Desktop, and i've also worked on other areas of Ubuntu in general, both via my kind sponsors and indirectly as a Debian Developer\n[16:07] &lt;rbasak&gt; Hi!\n[16:07] &lt;bandali&gt; hi! o/\n[16:07] &lt;rbasak&gt; " Becoming a core-dev would allow me to upload all kinds of desktop-related packages across the Ubuntu archive, not just the subset I have access to as a member of ~ubuntu-desktop (which excludes most packages in the desktop-core set)."\n[16:08] &lt;rbasak&gt; As above, I'm puzzled by this. Why aren't desktop-related packages that you need to upload as part of desktop work already the ubuntu-desktop packageset?\n[16:08] &lt;rbasak&gt; (maybe not really a question for you)\n[16:08] &lt;rbasak&gt; I ask because if we fixed that, surely that would help more people than just you?\n[16:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; Perhaps there are some packages that shouldn't belong in ubuntu-desktop for which you getting core dev privileges would help, but I'm unclear on what those are.\n[16:09] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; also, I note that there are endorsements from people who are not Ubuntu members/MOTU/core dev. Can they still endorse? I'd expect them to be in the "Comments" section.\n[16:09] &lt;bandali&gt; right, that's a great question but unfortunately i don't have the historical background (i wish Seb was here today). but i know it goes back at least 4 years, and most likely many more years before that\n[16:09] &lt;teward&gt; i have a followup on that, why do you need coredev if instead you could apply for the specific packagesets\n[16:09] &lt;teward&gt; (even if we didnt consolidate all the desktop pkgsets today)\n[16:09] &lt;rbasak&gt; Could you perhaps elaborate on exactly which packages you would like to upload, and which of those packages you have had sponsored, that do not belong in the ubuntu-desktop packageset?\n[16:09] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; if so, then only two core-devs which are both in ~Desktop. Are there people who you've worked outside ~Desktop?\n[16:10] &lt;bandali&gt; i'm applying for core-dev in part because i don't *only* work on desktop packages\n[16:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; i don't *only* work on desktop packages&gt; OK - could you elaborate then please on exactly which packages we're talking about?\n[16:12] &lt;bandali&gt; being a DD, i work on packages across the Debian archives (e.g. i maintain jami, opendht, restinio, etc.)\n[16:12] &lt;bandali&gt; i believe there a number of exampels of non-desktop packages i've worked on on my application page, if you search for 'non-desktop'\n[16:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK but I don't see any sponsored uploads of those packages into Ubuntu.\n[16:13] &lt;teward&gt; ^^ that\n[16:13] &lt;bandali&gt; how about poppler?\n[16:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; We should certainly consider PPU for the packages that you maintain in Debian\n[16:14] &lt;bandali&gt; i also do +1 rotations every now and again, and being able to upload those directly would be great\n[16:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; For a core dev application, I'd like to start by seeing your track record of sponsorship in Ubuntu for the packages that you are looking to upload. To be clear, I'm not saying that there's a hard requirement to have these, but I'd like to understand where you are and that's usually my starting point, and I'm struggling to identify the subset of your sponsored uploads that relate to this application.\n[16:15] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I was wondering if a path like packageset -&gt; MOTU -&gt; core-dev would be good. So essentially, MOTU being the next target?\n[16:15] &lt;bandali&gt; it so happens that for my last +1 shift i was able to do all of my work directly in Debian, but being able to do that work directly in Ubuntu would be nice\n[16:15] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; re: +1 work^\n[16:16] &lt;bandali&gt; i did initially consider MOTU first, but thought it might be good to skip directly to core-dev since i've worked on a number of non-desktop main packages like poppler etc. that aren't in universe and so not addressed by motu\n[16:17] &lt;bandali&gt; and thought that my background and experience as a DD would have provided me with the skills to aim directly for core-dev\n[16:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; I realise that poppler isn't strictly desktop since I suppose it can be used usefully in a server environment, but it does still feel desktop-y. Has it been considered for the ubuntu-desktop packageset?\n[16:18] &lt;bandali&gt; not that i know of, i'd defer to Seb to clarify that\n[16:19] &lt;bandali&gt; (also, to be clear, this is the part of the page i was referring to earlier: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/bandali/core-dev-application#non-desktop )\n[16:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; Did you take that from the sponsorship miner / udd? I'm looking the miner results at https://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/ubuntu-sponsorships.cgi?render=html&amp;sponsor=&amp;sponsor_search=name&amp;sponsoree=*bandali*&amp;sponsoree_search=name and it seems a bit messed up :-(\n[16:21] &lt;bandali&gt; err yes i think so\n[16:21] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I was gonna get to that, too :)\n[16:21] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; there seems to be a mismatch\n[16:21] &lt;bandali&gt; yeah e.g. some of that aren't SRUs\n[16:21] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; a lot of those uploads are uploads to Debian\n[16:21] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; and a sync here\n[16:22] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; that's why some won't show up in UDD\n[16:22] &lt;bandali&gt; sorry i probably should've cleaned that up beforehand. in my defence i wasn't sure if there would be a meeting today..\n[16:23] &lt;teward&gt; bandali: it's always best to **assume there will be a meeting** if you've placed yourself in the agenda\n[16:23] &lt;teward&gt; because otherwise you arrive here unprepared\n[16:23] &lt;bandali&gt; teward, that's what i assumed the last times it didn't happen :)\n[16:23] &lt;bandali&gt; but ack\n[16:25] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: I see almost all uploads by Jeremy and some by Seb. Whilst that's not a problem, I am wondering if you have worked with core-devs outside ~Desktop?\n[16:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; Do you have any SRU experience for regular bugfixes?\n[16:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; I only see https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtk4/4.12.3+ds-1ubuntu0.1 which looks like an upstream point release. Are there any other SRUs you've had sponsored?\n[16:26] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, yes indeed, just about all my uploads to Ubuntu have been sponsored by Jeremy and Seb\n[16:26] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, i believe i had several more. lemme see if i can find them quickly\n[16:28] &lt;sil2100&gt; bandali: related to rbasak's question: what do you need to consider when preparing for an SRU upload? What can be uploaded as an SRU, what is the process and how to make it land in a stable series?\n[16:28] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; and on that note, I had a question.What if a package X is on version 1.2.3-1 in Focal and 1.2.4-1 in Mantic, Jammy, Noble, and devel (Oracular now). And there's a bug you'd like to fix for X at least for Focal, what will be the next steps?\n[16:28] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, e.g. there's this nautilus one https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/1:42.6-0ubuntu1 but as a component of GNOME core, it has a micro-release exception\n[16:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm really looking for "regular" ones please\n[16:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; (since they exercise the SRU process much more compleely - do you have experience of doing that?)\n[16:30] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I have more questions, but I'll let you get the above ones squared away first :)\n[16:30] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, i recall doing some but i'm afraid i don't have a link handy at this moment. i'll let you know if i can find though\n[16:30] &lt;bandali&gt; sil2100, typing my answer to your question now\n[16:30] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; :(\n[16:30] &lt;sil2100&gt; Thank you! :)\n[16:32] &lt;bandali&gt; sil2100, generally speaking, SRUs should only contain bug fixes and no new features. the procedure is described on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates, including a sample template for the accompanying bug that needs to be filed on LP to explain the rationale for the SRU, its potential impact on users, and the bug(s) it aims to fix and how that can be validated (that it indeed fixes though\n[16:32] &lt;bandali&gt; bugs)\n[16:32] &lt;bandali&gt; (also including a test plan for testing and validation of the fix, of course)\n[16:33] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, typing an answer to your question now\n[16:35] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, generally the fix should also be prepared for all affected later Ubuntu releases as well, so that upgrading to newer releases wouldn't cause a regression again\n[16:35] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: okay, thanks, what versions would you use for each releases, then?\n[16:37] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, the versions of X would have to be crafted in a way to ensure that they are in increasing order from one Ubuntu release to the next, so that apt would correctly pick it up as an upgrade\n[16:37] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; yes, can you give me exact versions please?\n[16:37] &lt;sil2100&gt; bandali: thanks. And once the SRU gets accepted into -proposed, what does the uploader need to do? What are their responsibilities? When will the update be made avilable to the users?\n[16:38] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, e.g. 1.2.3-1ubuntu1 in focal, perhaps 1.2.3-2ubuntu1 in jammy, and 1.2.4-1ubuntu in mantic\n[16:40] &lt;bandali&gt; sil2100, the uploader would then do validation on the -proposed upload to verify that the indeed fixes all the bugs it claims to have fixed and introduced no regressions. then mark the bug as verification-done-$rel\n[16:41] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; I am afraid that's not quite correct :(\n[16:41] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdatePreparation :)\n[16:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; bandali: the uploader would then do validation&gt; specifically, what would be considered an acceptable level of validation, and what would not? At that stage in the process, how could the uploader be sure that the validation they're performing will be considered acceptable by the SRU team?\n[16:42] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, ack\n[16:42] &lt;bandali&gt; sil2100, once verified, the upload would then be released to users via -updates, potentially with phasing and monitoring that e.g. there are indeed no increased crash rates\n[16:44] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, the details would vary from one case to the next, but i believe at minimum the uploader would need to exercise the agreed upon test plan for the package being updated\n[16:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. And if, after an SRU you prepared is released, you discover that it resulted in a serious regression, what should you do?\n[16:45] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; re: +1 maint: once you've uploaded a package to the devel release, is there something else you should be doing?\n[16:47] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, if it's still in phasing, the phasing should be halted and a new SRU with the fix prepared. if it's ineed a serious/critical regression, one would need to prepare a new stop-gap upload effectively rolling the package back to previous version, while another upload could be prepared\n[16:48] &lt;rbasak&gt; bandali: OK, but what's the process to arrange these things?\n[16:49] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, generally, i'd check if the devel upload contains fixes potentially relevant to existing stable releases and if so, prepare an SRU.  i'd also check if my fix for Ubuntu could be applied upstream in Debian, or perhaps even better, directly to the main upstream project, and forward my patch(es) to them accordingly. if that's not quite the answer you were looking for, would you please\n[16:49] &lt;bandali&gt; clarify?\n[16:51] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, as in, e.g. what version to use for an upload of the previous working version?\n[16:53] &lt;rbasak&gt; bandali: sorry no that's not what I'm asking. Imagine you've just heard about this serious regression and Jeremy and Seb are unavailable. As a core dev, your team is looking to you to sort things out. What's the established process to alert the SRU team?\n[16:54] &lt;rbasak&gt; You may understand that the SRU team will stop phasing and/or urgently review your revert upload, but how is it that you will get their attention to do this?\n[16:55] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: my question is limited to the devel release you may upload to, once the upload is done, where does it go? what next steps you might want to work on to ensure the entire work's done?\n[16:56] &lt;bandali&gt; rbasak, for contacting the SRU team, i'd check https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Contacting_the_SRU_team to see who is on rotation that day, and ping them in #ubuntu-release or directly to draw their attention to the matter\n[16:57] &lt;teward&gt; fyi guys I have a hard-stop in 3 minutes\n[16:58] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; okay, I'll start to push this faster\n[16:58] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, oh, thanks for the clarification. normally, the upload to devel would land immediately. but that won't be the case e.g. during one of the devel freezes (where the package would land in -proposed) or if the package is NEW\n[16:58] &lt;bandali&gt; and would need to be manually reviewed and approved by an AA\n[16:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not sure we can conclude today :-(\n[16:59] &lt;teward&gt; rbasak: i don't think we can either, but feel free to continue the meeting\n[16:59] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: if I am not mistaken, the upload to devel don't just land to the -release pocket immediately.\n[16:59] &lt;teward&gt; just poke me when you need a vote\n[16:59] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; it goes to -proposed and then to -release subsequently\n[16:59] &lt;teward&gt; (I won't be able to do much else here at that point though, I already have my info I need for a vote)\n[17:00] &lt;bandali&gt; utkarsh2102, oh? i thought they only went through -proposed e.g. during freezes, but sorry if i got that wrong\n[17:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; do you know what's the process for an upload to move from -proposed to -release\n[17:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; teward: if you have your vote ready, can I proxy that if we conclude in a bit?\n[17:00] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; you could perhaps DM me and I can comment on your behald\n[17:00] &lt;teward&gt; utkarsh2102: i'll just leave it in paste so you can say "please vote" with a ping to me and i'll hit enter\n[17:01] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; teward: works perfectly for me\n[17:01] &lt;bandali&gt; not sure off top my head, i'm afraid. but i'd imagine a member of ubuntu-release would shepherd it through?\n[17:01] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; bandali: I am afraid not, it's the duty of the uploader to shepherd it\n[17:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; and only contact the release team when you've tried all the obvious things that are blocking the migration\n[17:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK I was somewhere between "more information would help me vote" and "I think we have some more adminstrative matters to resolve first". But I'm afraid your answers continue to give me concern and so I'm a hard -1 now, and I don't see any point in dragging this on further.\n[17:02] &lt;bandali&gt; ack\n[17:02] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; ok, are we ready to vote in that case?\n[17:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; I've been writing up more specifics to give you some guidance on what to work on here.

Right now I'm very unclear on this and this hampers me from objectively considering your application. If you already have a suitable track record, there's no reason to wait - we can just see it as an admistrative matter to help us\n[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; better assess your existing application.\n[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; 2) SRU knowledge and experience: I'd like to see experience of "regular" SRUs but so far I haven't seen anything apart from a couple of microrelease updates which follow a slightly different process. If you already have a suitable track record, there's no reason to wait - we can just see it as an admistrative matter to help us better assess your existing application. However, some of your\n[17:10] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #action Utkarsh to send out a follow-up mail on the ML\n[17:10] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: Utkarsh to send out a follow-up mail on the ML\n[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; SRU-relted answers missed the mark (eg. on versions and on flagging regressions). I feel that you should know these better - the answers are documented, or you improve your answers through experience.\n[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; 3) Proposed migration. "i thought they only went through -proposed e.g. during freezes, but sorry if i got that wrong". This is indeed wrong, and I think a hard requirement for any core dev to understand. I'm also confused on how you achieved doing +1 maintenance without this knowledge. This suggests to me that you're assuming incorrect things about Ubuntu from your knowledge of Debian without\n[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; appreciating the key points on how our development processes differ. Please continue learning this.\n[17:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; 4) That you worked on the poppler transition is good but looking at the actual uploads it's not clear to me if your contribution was driving the transition and that you understood the whole process, given your answer about proposed migration above. We didn't get to discussing this.\n[17:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; 5) The above list isn't exhaustive - we ran out of time to discuss further. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RobieBasak/DMB/CoreDev for my opinion and what I expect you to know.\n[17:11] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; that's phenomenal advice, Robie. Thanks! o/\n[17:11] &lt;bandali&gt; thank you indeed for your detailed reply/feedback Robie, appreciate it\n[17:11] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; since we're overtime, I'll stop here formally and end the meeting..\n[17:11] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; #endmeeting\n[17:11] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 17:11:43 UTC.

Bye. o/\n[17:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks. Please do reach out if anything is unclear, and/or if you'd like to go through my expectations before re-applying. I'd really like you fly through next time - your actual technical ability looks great and would be valuable for us to have!\n[17:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; But the Ubuntu-specific stuff needs more clarity I think.\n[17:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; I hope the above feedback is clear enough. I don't consider it acceptable to give anyone a -1 without clear and specific feedback, but I did have to write it in a hurry. Please let me know if anything doesn't make sense.\n[17:14] &lt;bandali&gt; looking back, i believe i knew the correct answer to at least two of the above questions. not sure what came over me and i fully blanked on them...\n[17:15] &lt;bandali&gt; your feedback makes a lot of sense, and once again is very much appreciated. i'll take it to heart and know better, and work on what needs improving\n[17:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; I appreciate that it's difficult in realtime and individuals perform very differently in this very unrealistic situation.

So basically I have a k8s pod that has a host mount to /etc/apparmor.d , and that pod is responsible for generating and enforcing profiles using "apparmor_parser" from within, and then it gets enforced on the host. But for some reason the profile seems to block pods that tries to access the K8s API.  \n[06:08] &lt;primalpimmy&gt; even though all network is allowed in the profile \n[06:08] &lt;primalpimmy&gt; type=AVC msg=audit(1713956546.682:24729): apparmor="DENIED" operation="create" profile="kubearmor-default" pid=41265 comm="kubearmor" family="inet" sock_type="stream" protocol=0 requested_mask="create" denied_mask="create"\n[06:10] &lt;primalpimmy&gt; to fix this, I again have to run "apparmor_parser" on the host instead of inside that pod, and now it works as it should.\n[07:02] &lt;mcphail&gt; https://ubuntu.com//blog/whats-new-in-security-for-ubuntu-24-04-lts - thanks for this post, amurray . Is the unprivileged namespace hardening the reason why I can't run docker in a nesting-enabled lxc or lxd container using the noble nightlies? Is there a way around that, if that's the case?\n[19:40] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: sarnold: because it came up on Ask Ubuntu (https://askubuntu.com/questions/1511606/pci-audit-openssh-authentication-bypass-vulnerability-cve-2023-51767), I'm poking regarding CVE-2023-51767.  Is only openssh-ssh1 affected?  Or are all openssh servers (and yes it's possible to enforce newer SSH versions if I remember right!) impacted?  The question came up because of PCI/DSS compliance.\n[19:40] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- OpenSSH through 9.6, when common types of DRAM are used, might allow row hammer attacks (for authentication bypass) because the integer value of authenticated in mm_answer_authpassword does not resist flips of a single bit. NOTE: this is applicable to a certain threat model of attacker-victim co-location in which the attacker has user privileges. &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-51767&gt;\n[19:59] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: could we also annotate the bug with https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3656 which states this: "This attack was not demonstrated against stock OpenSSH, but instead against a modified sshd that had extra synchronisation added to make the attack easier. AFAIK achieving the timing required to successfully exploit is close to impossible in the real world. See section 9 of their paper \n[19:59] &lt;teward&gt; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.02545.pdf They don't mention it, but any kind of ASLR would increase the difficulty of attack by several orders of magnitude. Nobody has demonstrated this attack against a configuration remotely approximating real-world conditions. We consider rowhammer mitigation to the job of the platform, not userspace software."\n[19:59] -ubottu:#ubuntu-security- bugzilla.mindrot.org bug 3656 in Portable OpenSSH "How to fix row hammer attacksï¼" [Security, New]\n[19:59] &lt;teward&gt; s/annotate the bug/annotate the CVE/\n[20:00] &lt;teward&gt; because it looks like the paper on this exploit is not possible in Real World Implementations\n[20:04] &lt;JanC&gt; so basically this is only relevant if you still use Ubuntu from before 2005?\n[20:05] &lt;teward&gt; JanC: from what i'm reading even latest OpenSSH in 24.04 is impacted, but upon additional diving into the linked CVE and its papers on arxiv and other documentation, it requires very specific circumstances to happen\n[20:06] &lt;teward&gt; and by very specific I mean modified sshd and a configuration that wouldn't be sane in the real world\n[20:10] &lt;JanC&gt; and when people change their sshd that's not Ubuntu's responsibility\n[20:11] &lt;teward&gt; correct\n[20:11] &lt;JanC&gt; also, I'd expect this to be mostly a problem on servers, but those would use ECC in most cases...\n[20:12] &lt;teward&gt; the core problem however is PCI/DSS compliance scans are stupid and don't take into account when these CVEs have very VERY specific *theoretical only* cases of exploit\n[20:12] &lt;teward&gt; hence the only reason i'm poking xD\n[20:12] &lt;JanC&gt; and I think ECC would prevent this exploit too?\n[20:14] &lt;JanC&gt; or at least make it much harder too\n[20:14] &lt;teward&gt; yeah that's the point any kind of implementation of ASLR makes it difficult, and Linux has had that since 2005 so\n[20:15] &lt;teward&gt; it makes it several orders of magnitude more difficult, and there's no real-world conditions approximated config nor stock OpenSSH confirmed affected by this, especially when we dig into the paper\n[20:15] &lt;teward&gt; this CVE probably should've been marked as an experimental or theory-only case and not a CVCSS 7.0 IMO\n[20:18] &lt;sdeziel&gt; the paper specifically calls out that ECC isn't a good defense: `in 2019 showed that the ECC countermeasure is not secure either`\n[20:20] &lt;JanC&gt; it might not be a full defence, but if your system suddenly gets a million ECC errors that would probably make the admins suspicious?  :)\n[20:27] &lt;sdeziel&gt; JanC: yeah that's also my understanding, I just wanted to mention that's no silver bullet unfortunately. HW is hard (too) it seems :)\n[20:53] &lt;teward&gt; sdeziel: we also have to keep in mind that there's a lot of mitigations that just *naturally* work and sane defaults tend to mitigate the risk by orders of magnitude\n[20:54] &lt;teward&gt; so default kernel ASLR and such, sane configis for a real-world setup, etc. seem to be the proper mitigations, and nobody's proposed or shown a *real world* usable exploit that isn't a shared-neighbor type local-only attack vector with user creds\n[20:58] &lt;sdeziel&gt; teward: I didn't read the paper but a quick look at it showed it talks about password auth which is indeed not a sane config\n[20:58] &lt;teward&gt; yeah i glanced it\n[21:06] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; teward: sure, I'll add the upstream bug to it tomorrow\n[21:07] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: thank you kindly\n[21:07] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; btw, pretty much everything is vulnerable to rowhammer issues and there's nothing we can do about it except stop using computers\n[21:07] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; every year someone comes out with a new practical attack\n[21:07] &lt;teward&gt; mdeslaur: true. the problem is PCI/DSS compliance checks flag that as a problem\n[21:07] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; that isn't my problem :)\n[21:07] &lt;teward&gt; despite veryone KNOWING rowhammer is still a vulnerability\n[21:07] &lt;teward&gt; nope\n[21:08] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; I will add more details to the CVE tomorrow, I'll take another look at it\n[21:08] &lt;teward&gt; but as long as we annotate the bug with notes, etc. so people can JUSTIFY why it can't be fixed (there is no solution for rowhammer attacks!) things're better\n[21:08] &lt;teward&gt; cool cool mdeslaur thanks,\n\n# UBUNTU-MEETING\n\n=== dviererbe1 is now known as dviererbe\n\n</content></entry><entry><id>24.04.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</id><title>24.04.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><updated>2024-06-09T19:08:07.746890+00:00</updated><content># UBUNTU-SECURITY\n\n=== chris14_ is now known as chris14\n=== locutusofborg_ is now known as locutusofborg\n=== wete_ is now known as wete\n=== vx^ is now known as vx\n\n# UBUNTU-MEETING\n\n=== dviererbe1 is now known as dviererbe\n=== utkarsh51 is now known as utkarsh2102\n\n</content></entry><entry><id>23.04.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</id><title>23.04.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><updated>2024-06-09T19:08:07.745990+00:00</updated><content># UBUNTU-SECURITY\n\n=== chris14_ is now known as chris14\n=== JanC is now known as Guest4088\n=== JanC is now known as Guest3279\n=== ahasenack_ is now known as ahasenack\n\n# UBUNTU-MEETING\n\n=== JanC is now known as Guest4088\n=== JanC is now known as Guest3279\n[14:30] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hey\n[14:31] &lt;didrocks&gt; o/ (for once, in a meeting, but mostly around)\n[14:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status\n[14:31] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 14:31:27 UTC.

That would reduce the component mismatches already\n[14:34] &lt;sarnold&gt; are we suggesting to leave them buggy or change the arch: lines to remove those buggy arches?\n[14:34] &lt;slyon&gt; it's already a mismatch, so .. meh\n[14:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we do not really promote just some arches\n[14:34] &lt;slyon&gt; I do not mean in promotion, but in the MIR test requirements\n[14:34] &lt;slyon&gt; cc adrien\n[14:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm failing to find the test issues in the logs that are linked on libtracefs\n[14:38] &lt;dviererbe&gt; o/\n[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think if we not build this for ppc64 and s390x IBM and IBM users would be rather unhappy\n[14:38] &lt;sarnold&gt; hi dviererbe\n[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the question is can it be fixed later\n[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; or not\n[14:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; is there new insight in that?\n[14:38] &lt;slyon&gt; IMO we should still build it, but just accept ppc64el and s390x autopkgtest failing (for now) â to be fixed later\n[14:39] &lt;slyon&gt; at least now we know that it's broken on ppc64el and s390x, whereas before (without tests) it was just broken\n[14:39] &lt;sarnold&gt; https://autopkgtest.ubuntu.com/packages/libtracefs -- some fails here?\n[14:40] &lt;slyon&gt; sarnold: we just have the superficial test in the archive, still. adrien added _actual_ tests in his PPA, but those fail on ppc and s390x\n[14:40] &lt;sarnold&gt; ahh\n[14:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; now things make sense again\n[14:40] &lt;slyon&gt; see two latest comments on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libtracefs/+bug/2051925\n[14:40] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2051925 in libtracefs (Ubuntu) "[MIR] promote libtracefs as a trace-cmd dependency" [Undecided, Incomplete]\n[14:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think under those conditions, and given the time let us promote it but please commit to continue working with upstream and IBM to fix it\n[14:41] &lt;slyon&gt; we're on it already and it will show up in our usual proposed-migration report\n[14:41] &lt;slyon&gt; adrien: Can you get the current tests uploaded into noble-proposed?\n[14:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah - and with then then promoting it\n[14:42] &lt;adrien&gt; slyon: I'm preparing the MR right now\n[14:42] &lt;adrien&gt; I'm also backlogging here (I arrived a minute ago)\n[14:42] &lt;slyon&gt; cool, thanks. So let's move it to "In Progress" for now?\n[14:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is already in mismatches\n[14:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so someone else would not understand why not fix comitted\n[14:42] &lt;slyon&gt; oh right\n[14:42] &lt;adrien&gt; I also updated the LP bug not long ago so some of you might have to refresh the page\n[14:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: you might do a summary what we decided here as a comment\n[14:43] &lt;slyon&gt; Will do.\n[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks\n[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Going on to get more cases discussed\n[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; from the proposed mismatches\n[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; python-boto3 and botocore and s3transfer\n[14:43] &lt;adrien&gt; thanks\n[14:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I've done a review on all of them, but the cases were not yet fully ready for a post and since then I'm debugging the beta\n[14:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I can post my reviews in a bit, but here the TL;DR\n[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; boto3 abd botocore are fine - they mostly lack tests which aciba is working on right now\n[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the important thing is that they replace something much worse\n[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the old version has been discontinued by upstream ages ago and isn't compatible with the python in noble\n[14:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; So we have two options:\n[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; remember: they are ok once the tests land, but need security review then\n[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; a) schedule a security review, but let them in now\n[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; b) do not promote them in time for noble\n[14:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I do not consider an asap review it the next hours a fair ask for @security\n[14:47] &lt;slyon&gt; Is this a release blocker?\n[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; my argument for (a) would be that all that is proposed while not yet having a review is replacing code that is much older and worse\n[14:47] &lt;slyon&gt; I assume the issue is that we do not want to support the old unmaintained thing for 10+ years?\n[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is a maintenance concern\n[14:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; aciba: who joined works on it the last few days\n[14:47] &lt;slyon&gt; I have a tendency towards (a) as well, but this is cutting corners with security review..\n[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is not breaking the release, hence no strict blocker - but it would be much much better\n[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold:  or eslerm_ what do you think about (a) vs (b)\n[14:48] &lt;sarnold&gt; there's apparently some new code in here, too "Whilst looking at the package with Alberto, we found that python3-s3transfer, one of the boto3's runtime dependencies, is in Universe, too."\n[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yep, the old python-boto did it all by itself\n[14:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; upstream broke that up in individual libs to do these things\n[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; moving from boto to boto3 on its own isn't *too* worrying. I'm unhappy that this is only discovered this week but I can kinda understand how we got here. but dragging in a whole new s3 support layer is big ask in the final week.\n[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; is this the old boto s3 support split out?\n[14:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; does anything else use this s3 support?\n[14:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; AFAICS boto3 and botocore are split out evolutions\n[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; s3transfer is only used by boto\n[14:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; do we actually care about s3 for simplestreams?\n[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; in fact it is only considered to be useful in boto3 as they evolve together\n[14:50] &lt;sarnold&gt; can we stub it out?\n[14:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; aciba: ^^ ?\n[14:51] &lt;aciba&gt; I think we can, I superficially grep cpc and mass code and they do not use it\n[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I assume the problem is that we might beak other users of that library if we'd remove s3 from boto3\n[14:51] &lt;aciba&gt; but I am not 100% sure\n[14:51] &lt;sarnold&gt; hmm. good point. sigh.\n[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; all those three are the newer set of libs\n[14:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and it would allow to demote the old unmaintained one\n[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that is kind of what makes me suggest to let them in and demote the old\n[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and schedule but not wait for the security review\n[14:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; iff you can do both operations in the same minute...\n[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the code isn't new - it is just universe -&gt; main\n[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah - I can do both at once once ready\n[14:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; waiting for the tests by aciba\n[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we'd like to get this out of proposed by ~tomorrow I'd assume to not be in the way of RC images\n[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; aciba: can you get tests done by mid day tomorrow?\n[14:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; I think I'm coming around to your way of thinking, but I'm not real keen on "just wait until the last week" being used as a way to get beyond the MIR process.\n[14:53] &lt;eslerm_&gt; ^\n[14:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: I agree, but have no better option\n[14:53] &lt;aciba&gt; I have 3 MRs up, adding build tests and autopkg test, I am verifying autopkgtest work\n[14:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; cpaelzer: I mean, the kernel team had their kernels yanked from the upcoming release due to missing deadlines\n[14:54] &lt;aciba&gt; I think I could, assuming I have someone reviewing, pushing to -proposed\n[14:54] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and they add it back as we speak\n[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm unsure - should we vote\n[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this isn't perfect and clean . otherwise we would have settled by now\n[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but even time for the meeting runs out :-/\n[14:55] &lt;sarnold&gt; heh :(\n[14:55] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so to get conclusion on this non-easy case ...\n[14:55] &lt;sarnold&gt; yeah, I'm fine with a vote\n[14:56] &lt;sarnold&gt; but I'd like us to consider how to avoid this situation in future cycles\n[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I guess we can be sure that noboday wanted or planned for this\n[14:56] &lt;eslerm_&gt; I would really like to see an unmaintained package leave main, otoh there is not time to review and s3 is something that certainly needs security review\n[14:56] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the problem is that simplestreams being in an ownership nimbus between teams\n[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Calling for a vote +1 to let it in under the mentioned constraints (add tests, schedule security review, follow up on findings) -1 to keep the deprecated old python-boto\n[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; +1 (for a lack of a better option)\n[14:57] &lt;slyon&gt; +1 (same)\n[14:57] &lt;sarnold&gt; +1 (but grumpy about it)\n[14:57] &lt;eslerm_&gt; +/- 0 (non-vote)\n[14:57] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; joalif: didrocks: around?\n[14:58] &lt;joalif&gt;

and thanks aciba to pick this up in the first place\n[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; or we would not even have that option to discuss\n[14:58] &lt;aciba&gt; thanks!\n[14:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; aciba: I'll later complete and post my review\n[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and let you know if there is something big other than waiting for tests\n[14:59] &lt;sarnold&gt; aciba: aye, yes, please don't take this personally. it's better to find and point it out. i'm just dissapointed that we didn't find this in the previous N cycles.\n[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'd then bring it up in tomorrow daily release meeting\n=== dviererbe1 is now known as dviererbe\n[14:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; to get an ack by release folks before moving it in (or killing it if they object)\n[14:59] &lt;aciba&gt;

I cannot yet estimate the side effects\n[15:09] &lt;enr0n&gt; IMO yes. Otherwise we are asking for a fun flood of bug reports about this\n[15:09] &lt;juliank&gt; Not sure + yes is a yes\n[15:09] &lt;slyon&gt; alright\n[15:10] &lt;juliank&gt; tagged\n[15:10] &lt;juliank&gt; targeted to 24.04\n[15:11] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2060581 is already staged so untagged it\n[15:11] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2060581 in apport (Ubuntu) "stop shipping debian-installer package hook" [Low, Fix Committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2060581\n[15:13] &lt;juliank&gt; bug 2060220 seems straightforward\n[15:13] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2060220 in ubuntu-release-upgrader (Ubuntu) "Prevent release upgrades for users running on armhf" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2060220\n[15:13] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: I saw a package that needed to migrate but it had picked up a versioned dep on your libdebian-installer NCR ;P\n[15:14] &lt;schopin&gt; I don't know. I think the problem raised here that you'll get a mix of 23.10 and 24.04 packages is already the case on any other arch?\n[15:14] &lt;juliank&gt; sigh\n[15:14] &lt;juliank&gt; This isn't _really_ a problem\n[15:14] &lt;juliank&gt; u-r-u offers to remove obsolete packages (mantic-noble/jammy-noble)\n[15:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; as I said in the bug comment I think this should be a raspi-specific quirk\n[15:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; since that's the supported platform whose kernel gets dropped\n[15:15] &lt;waveform&gt; indeed\n[15:15] &lt;juliank&gt; I think it should be a quirk for some "key packages"\n[15:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; and we shouldn't let users think they've upgraded to a supported LTS when the #1 CVE target is unsupported\n[15:16] &lt;juliank&gt; I mean block upgrades if any package they use from main got dropped\n[15:17] &lt;bdmurray&gt; How can we check if they are on an RPi?\n[15:18] &lt;juliank&gt; check the kernel\n[15:18] &lt;waveform&gt; hmm, checking for linux-raspi is usually a good sign, but theoretically isn't enough\n[15:18] &lt;juliank&gt; linux-raspi-*\n[15:18] &lt;juliank&gt; linux-image-raspi-*\n[15:18] &lt;waveform&gt; (if it's installed it may not be flashed as the actual booting kernel; so uname -r with a -raspi suffix is probably a good sign for the running kernel)\n[15:19] &lt;waveform&gt; alternately, check for raspberrypi in /proc/device-tree/compatible if it exists\n[15:19] &lt;waveform&gt; (substring)\n[15:20] &lt;juliank&gt; I think package is more interesting tbh\n[15:20] &lt;waveform&gt; package can be installed (but not flashed) on generic arm64 hardware\n[15:21] &lt;waveform&gt; (yes, that's stupid, but possible :)\n[15:21] &lt;juliank&gt; I know but still the image as a whole would be unsupported\n[15:21] &lt;juliank&gt; maybe you are building the image on your other arm64 hardware and then want to put it into a pi\n[15:21] &lt;juliank&gt; :D\n[15:21] &lt;waveform&gt; but the test is for "are we running on a pi?"\n[15:22] &lt;juliank&gt; Yes, but I prefer to be safe than sorry :D\n[15:23] &lt;juliank&gt; And that gives us an easier way to mark other packages\n[15:23] &lt;juliank&gt;

just to be sure everyone know: we've had a lot of "no space left on device" issues recently on autopkgtest.

Just did a "touch"\n[00:10] &lt;sarnold&gt; we've got an 'include if exists' but I don't see anything using that yet :/ so I don't know if this should be the first or if it's better to just follow along the pattern that the others do\n[00:10] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; looks like my umask is lax\n[00:10] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; I thought of that, but I don't think it exists in xenial\n[00:11] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; let me see if I have a xenial vm...\n[00:11] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; just to make sure\n[00:12] &lt;sarnold&gt; *xenial* ugh I forgot\n[00:12] &lt;sarnold&gt; yeah just stick with what you've got\n[00:12] &lt;sarnold&gt; I can't recall when this was introduced but xenial seems likely to be pushing it :)\n[00:14] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; it's not in the xenial apparmor.d manapge, but is in the jammy one\n[00:14] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; x:            INCLUDE = '#include' ( ABS PATH | MAGIC PATH )\n[00:15] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; j:            INCLUDE = ( '#include' | 'include' ) [ 'if exists' ] ( ABS PATH | MAGIC PATH )\n[00:15] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; was added somewhere in between\n[00:15] &lt;sarnold&gt; i'm glad you went looking rather than just using it :)\n[00:21] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; not my first xenial apparmor profile in the recent months ;)\n[00:21] &lt;ahasenack_&gt; was bitten before\n[00:24] &lt;sarnold&gt; hehehe :(\n=== chris14_ is now known as chris14\n[15:57] &lt;UnivrslSuprBox&gt; USP 224 was an excellent look over the xz-utils backdoor.

We don't have a way to allow for local customizations of child profiles, defined inside a profile?\n[13:46] &lt;ahasenack&gt; like this scenario: https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/bDgk4g3Q33/\n[13:47] &lt;ahasenack&gt; profile foo could be adapted via new config in local/foo (but not override explicit DENYs it might have, AIUI)\n[13:47] &lt;ahasenack&gt; but pofiles bar, ugh, and another, cannot be adapted\n[13:49] &lt;georgiag&gt; i guess you could add "include &lt;local/foobar&gt;" under profile bar\n[13:51] &lt;georgiag&gt; but yeah, that has not been done. I'm not sure if that's something just out of my head but I always saw child profiles as self contained so I didn't find it weird it didn't allow for customizations\n[13:55] &lt;ahasenack&gt; yeah, they are usually tailored to how the main application is calling the other executables, and not meant as a general profile\n[13:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; for example, I have a dpkg child profile, and I'm 100% sure it would not be applicable as a general dpkg profile\n[13:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; because I only care about how my app calls dpkg, and it's never in a "install a package for me" mode\n[13:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; so the child profile is much simpler, and tighter\n[13:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; but there could be bugs\n[13:56] &lt;ahasenack&gt; I guess I'm seeing this include from local as a way to work around bugs in the profile without having to change the main config file\n[14:00] &lt;georgiag&gt; ah right. I don't see local as a way to fix bugs. like for example if I want to compile my own qemu and have libvirt point to my own qemu instead, I would add it to local/usr.sbin.libvirtd. or having a config file in a non-default place and allowing it in the local profile, etc. the end result is the same\n[14:01] &lt;ahasenack&gt; well, one classical case of local overrides is home directories\n[14:01] &lt;ahasenack&gt; a home dir doesn't have to be in /home/$user :)\n[14:01] &lt;ahasenack&gt; classic snap complaint, btw\n[14:09] &lt;georgiag&gt; yep, thats true!\n\n# UBUNTU-MEETING\n\n=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk\n=== JanC_ is now known as JanC\n=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk\n=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk\n=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk\n[15:29] &lt;sarnold&gt; good morning\n[15:29] &lt;eslerm_&gt; good morning o/\n[15:32] &lt;slyon&gt; heyho o/\n[15:33] &lt;slyon&gt; Looks like c_paelzer is out...\n[15:33] &lt;slyon&gt; I can run the meeting.

Unfortunately things are so busy I don't think we have capacity before noble's release\n[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks seb128, that is all I wanted - you gave jbicha the time to have a look\n[15:46] &lt;slyon&gt; +1 on implementing at least a basic set of tests, if that is an option\n[15:48] &lt;sarnold&gt; another possibility if it's just too hard to test during build or too fickle to test during autopkgtest is the 'manual testing plan' and assurances that it'd be run on every update; we haven't done this in a while, is it still an option or did we push strongly enough for fully automated testing that we removed the manual testing plan?\n[15:48] &lt;jbicha&gt; eslerm_: I believe the takeaway on fdk-aac-free was "No for 24.04 LTS, can re-evaluate later to check for improvement in security handling"\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I write a bug update ...\n[15:48] &lt;sarnold&gt; if upstream has already abandoned the older versions, it'd be unfun to stick on it for the next ten years vs this one, which might be replaced by freerdp4 in another five or so :)\n[15:49] &lt;jbicha&gt; sarnold: oh, I have a minimal manual test plan for both Remmina &amp; gnome-remote-desktop https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/TestPlans/RemoteDesktop\n[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; updated https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/remmina/+bug/2057842 jbicha\n[15:50] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2057842 in remmina (Ubuntu) "FFe: [MIR] freedp2 -&gt; freerdp3 in main" [Undecided, Fix Committed]\n[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I hope that is ok as the compromise we found here\n[15:50] &lt;eslerm_&gt; jbicha: if fdk-aac-free is causing the change from freerdp3 to freerdp2, please message me.

And what freeze applies to the archive at the moment?\n[19:05] &lt;mirespace&gt; In the  Noble Schedule: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-schedule/35649\n[19:06] &lt;mirespace&gt; We are in Feature Freeze\n[19:06] &lt;sil2100&gt; (/me will have a question when rbasak is done with his)\n[19:06] &lt;mirespace&gt; and also, you can find that info on IRC, the topic of #ubuntu-devel and #ubuntu-release on Libera Chat is generally updated to indicate the current freeze status.\n[19:07] &lt;rbasak&gt; sil2100: ack\n[19:08] &lt;rbasak&gt; mirespace: if a package is on version 1.2-3ubuntu1 and you're considering uploading 1.2.1-0ubuntu1, then what information do you need to decide if the upload would be acceptable during feature freeze?\n[19:09] &lt;mirespace&gt; the -0 before the ubuntu is telling that we are uploading a version from upstream that us not in Debian, and it would be acceptable if the diff between that versions includes fixes\n[19:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; Is there anything that might be present in the diff that would make the upload unacceptable?\n[19:11] &lt;mirespace&gt; cosmetic changes that makes the review more difficult and new features described in the changelog or CHANGES file\n[19:11] &lt;rbasak&gt; What if the diff contains new features that aren't described in the changelog or CHANGES file?\n[19:12] &lt;mirespace&gt; do you mean new features per se, not fixing/ or correcting a anormal behaviour?\n[19:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; Yes - so for example imagine that on examining the diff, you notice something that is without doubt a new feature.\n[19:14] &lt;mirespace&gt; So, we are talking about a MicroRelease upgrade, and we would need a microrelease exception in place (approved by the release team) to allow it\n[19:14] &lt;mirespace&gt; MRE\n[19:15] &lt;mirespace&gt; in thios case, the .1 before the -0 points to a microrelease upgrade\n[19:15] &lt;mirespace&gt; s/thios/thios/\n[19:15] &lt;mirespace&gt; aaah... *this\n[19:16] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK thanks. Let's move on. I have more questions, but shall we take turns? sil2100 do you want to go next?\n[19:16] &lt;sil2100&gt; o/\n[19:16] &lt;mirespace&gt; o?\n[19:16] &lt;sil2100&gt; I have 2 small questions\n[19:16] &lt;mirespace&gt; o/\n[19:16] &lt;mirespace&gt; ok\n[19:17] &lt;mirespace&gt; ups (MRE approved by SRU team, sorry)\n[19:17] &lt;sil2100&gt; 1) When preparing an SRU, we require filling out the 'template' information in the bug. Part of the template is the Regression Potential / Where problems could occur section. Can you tell me what it is for?\n[19:18] &lt;sil2100&gt; What is the purpose of that section?\n[19:18] &lt;mirespace&gt; With that part, the uploader demonstrates that the risk of the upload had been deeply considered\n[19:19] &lt;seb128&gt; o/ (queuing for a question after Lukasz)\n[19:19] &lt;mirespace&gt; Thinking about what else could occurs if my package lands in the archive... not only dfailures of the package itlself\n[19:19] &lt;mirespace&gt; also, how it could affect othe packages that usally interacts with it\n[19:20] &lt;mirespace&gt; or user/third party scripts that use any part of the package uploaded\n[19:20] &lt;sil2100&gt; Okay, second question:\n[19:21] &lt;sil2100&gt; 2) When you prepare and upload your SRU, and it gets accepted by the SRU team into -proposed, what are your next responsibilities regarding the SRU? What is expected of you?\n[19:22] &lt;mirespace&gt; me (or anyone else) should test the package in -proposed to verify the bug is fixed\n[19:22] &lt;mirespace&gt; with the test plan provided by me in the sru template\n[19:22] &lt;mirespace&gt; that is used to fill the bug\n[19:22] &lt;mirespace&gt; if the package, later, it's released because the aging period is reached\n[19:23] &lt;mirespace&gt; I should take a look to the component mistmached page to see if the package builds OK or have a regression (itself or with other packages)\n[19:24] &lt;mirespace&gt; I mean, taking care it passes the tests (DEP8) for the archs it builds\n[19:24] &lt;mirespace&gt; the comp0onent mismatche no, the update excuses, sorry\n[19:24] &lt;sil2100&gt; You mentioned component mismatches?\n[19:24] &lt;sil2100&gt; Ah, yes\n[19:24] &lt;sil2100&gt; This is what I wanted to see!\n[19:24] &lt;mirespace&gt; https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html\n[19:24] &lt;mirespace&gt; (too much MIR work lately, sorry)\n[19:25] &lt;mirespace&gt; :)\n[19:25] &lt;sil2100&gt; mirespace: this is the update_excuses page for the development series. If, say, you had an upload in jammy, where would you look for autopkgtest results?\n[19:25] &lt;mirespace&gt; https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/jammy/update_excuses.html\n[19:26] &lt;mirespace&gt; the scheme would be :  https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/&lt;supported_series&gt;/update_excuses.html\n[19:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Ok, thanks! That's enough from me\n[19:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; seb128, rbasak: ^\n[19:27] &lt;rbasak&gt; seb128: over to you\n[19:27] &lt;seb128&gt; mirespace, you mentioned a MRE earlier ... what is a MRE for you and where/to which serie does that apply?\n[19:28] &lt;mirespace&gt; we want to provide to users of our supported series (LTS or interim at the moment of the MRE) with the more stable experience when using a piece of software\n[19:29] &lt;mirespace&gt; to provide this, sometimes is needed to upgrade versions of packages in stable releases that include not only security fixes : new features too, in the sense\n[19:30] &lt;mirespace&gt; of replacing supporting of a feature/protocol/package  that is going to dissapear\n[19:30] &lt;mirespace&gt; or to maintain the package usable in a supported series\n[19:31] &lt;mirespace&gt; It's used mostly for packages that impact the series/are very used in the community\n[19:31] &lt;mirespace&gt; i.e., dpdk\n[19:31] &lt;seb128&gt; mirespace, so for a such case what would be the process? would you need to ask for the exception (and if so how/to who)? or is there any guideline describing those exception cases?\n[19:32] &lt;mirespace&gt; You need to follow https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#New_upstream_microreleases\n[19:33] &lt;mirespace&gt; Writting the MRE exception to be included into the https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates, once approved by the SRU team\n[19:33] &lt;seb128&gt; mirespace, ok, thanks for your replies, that's enough for me :)\n[19:34] &lt;mirespace&gt; in that exception you need to expose the reasons about why we should do it, what extra test we are doing\n[19:34] &lt;mirespace&gt; and special considerations to take care (release cadence, for example)\n[19:34] &lt;mirespace&gt; ok ... sorry for continuing answering :$\n[19:34] &lt;seb128&gt; no worry, please keep writting if you have more to say\n[19:35] &lt;mirespace&gt; it's ok :)\n[19:35] &lt;seb128&gt; it's sometime difficult in written to know when the other side is done write\n[19:35] &lt;seb128&gt; just finish with some sort of &lt;/end&gt; :)\n[19:35] &lt;mirespace&gt; I agree totally wit you on that\n[19:35] &lt;mirespace&gt; good idea\n[19:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK I guess that line of questions is done? I was going to ask about proposed migration in the development release, but you've already basically answered my question above.\n[19:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; So I have no further questions.\n[19:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; Anyone else?\n[19:36] &lt;seb128&gt; no further question from me\n[19:38] &lt;rbasak&gt; #vote Grant mirespace upload access to the ubuntu-server packageset\n[19:38] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Grant mirespace upload access to the ubuntu-server packageset\n[19:38] &lt;meetingology&gt; Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')\n[19:38] &lt;rbasak&gt; +1\n[19:38] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from rbasak\n[19:38] &lt;sil2100&gt; +1\n[19:38] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from sil2100\n[19:39] &lt;seb128&gt; +1 (though I think there is some confusions about MRE and rules applying to SRU of micro-releases, that's not a blocker for a set application but should be resolved on the way to coredev)\n[19:39] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 (though I think there is some confusions about MRE and rules applying to SRU of micro-releases, that's not a blocker for a set application but should be resolved on the way to coredev) received from seb128\n[19:39] &lt;mirespace&gt; I'll work on that seb128:\n[19:40] &lt;bdmurray&gt; +1\n[19:40] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from bdmurray\n[19:40] &lt;rbasak&gt; kanashiro: vote?\n[19:40]  * bdmurray needs to run though\n[19:42] &lt;seb128&gt; mirespace, the policy section you referred to is about microreleases including bugfixing, it doesn't cover features. Also usually a MRE is a special rule you ask for a special projects (like you mentioned for services); it wouldn't be the solution to a new feature being added to a microrelease of a random package\n[19:43] &lt;seb128&gt; mirespace, also I got slightly confused that the MRE mention came in a discussion about feature freeze, which means devel release and not a stable one, so the process would be a FFe\n[19:44] &lt;mirespace&gt; yes, you're right... i had in my notes new upstream (microrelease)\n[19:44] &lt;mirespace&gt; for FFe\n[19:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; #endvote\n[19:45] &lt;meetingology&gt; Voting ended on: Grant mirespace upload access to the ubuntu-server packageset\n[19:45] &lt;meetingology&gt; Votes for: 4, Votes against: 0, Abstentions: 0\n[19:45] &lt;meetingology&gt; Motion carried\n[19:45] &lt;mirespace&gt; I have got a prepared answer about FFe\n[19:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; Congratulations mirespace!\n[19:45] &lt;seb128&gt; mirespace, congratulations!\n[19:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; #action rbasak to announce mirespace's successful application\n[19:45] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: rbasak to announce mirespace's successful application\n[19:45] &lt;mirespace&gt; thank you! _sweating_\n[19:45] &lt;rbasak&gt; #action rbasak to adjust ACLs for mirespace's successful application\n[19:45] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: rbasak to adjust ACLs for mirespace's successful application\n[19:46] &lt;sil2100&gt; Congrats!\n[19:46] &lt;rbasak&gt; #topic Review of previous action items\n[19:46] &lt;mirespace&gt; MRE page caught : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Documentation_for_Special_Cases aaah\n[19:47] &lt;rbasak&gt; The two people with actions aren't here, so I'll carry them both over.\n[19:47] &lt;rbasak&gt; #action Utkarsh to review the tasks for a DMB election and decide if he can take that on.

It should be on the public list really :-/\n[19:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; seb128: given you replied today, shall we treat it as making progress, and follow up next time?\n[19:50] &lt;seb128&gt; +1\n[19:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; I don't see anything else unaddressed on the ML.\n[19:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; #topic Open TB bugs\n[19:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; #info No open TB bugs\n[19:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; #topic AOB\n[19:51] &lt;seb128&gt; what bdmurray said ^\n[19:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thank you for noting the schedule.\n[19:51] &lt;seb128&gt; kanashiro, bdmurray and me will have our membership expired by the next meeting\n[19:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; I guess in Utkarsh's absence perhaps we should assume that the answer is that no, he doesn't have the capacity, and so we should find someone else to run it?\n[19:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; ...and the other seats expire on 16 June\n[19:53] &lt;seb128&gt; I think it would be nice but any idea who the someone could be?\n[19:53] &lt;rbasak&gt; I have done it in the past and am happy to volunteer to do it again\n[19:53] &lt;seb128&gt; also I don't remember how we ended up there but it's unfortunate those expirations are back to back\n[19:53] &lt;rbasak&gt; I would like to combine the two sets though, rather than run two elections two months apart.\n[19:53] &lt;seb128&gt; +1 from me\n[19:54] &lt;seb128&gt; to be clear +1 for you to handle it but also for combining\n[19:54] &lt;rbasak&gt; Since the results are ranked, we can agree that the top three ranking candidates will take their seats immediately, and the other four will take their seats in June.\n[19:54] &lt;sil2100&gt; Same here\n[19:54]  * sil2100 needs to drop, sadly o/\n[19:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; unfortunate hose expirations are back to back&gt; should we try to re-stagger them?\n[19:55] &lt;seb128&gt; unsure how we do that, it's also late in the slot to have that discussion now?\n[19:56] &lt;rbasak&gt; For example, normally the term is two years. We could make the second set one year only, so then we'll have two halves (modulo integer division) staggered one year apart again.\n[19:56] &lt;seb128&gt; I would say just go with the election and the new board can put that on their agenda\n[19:59] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let me write to the list with a detailed proposal, since there are some other bits I can think of that I need agreement for in order that the combined election will work.\n[19:59] &lt;rbasak&gt; Anything else to discuss?\n[20:00] &lt;seb128&gt; not from me\n[20:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; #endmeeting\n[20:00] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 20:00:06 UTC.

They are currently busy, so we should not expect a centralized solution soon.

not urgent but I would still like to see them finalise their list before the LTS goes out\n[20:10] &lt;vorlon&gt; indeed\n[20:11] &lt;amurray&gt; hmm also should there be an action item on me for the kubuntu LTS request?\n[20:11] &lt;amurray&gt;

ack\n[20:14] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic AOB\n[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; one item for AOB\n[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; I noticed when doing a "census" from the Release Team side of our LTS qualifications\n[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; that Ubuntu MATE doesn't appear to have applied yet for LTS status\n[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; does someone want to reach out to them and find out if they plan to?\n[20:14] &lt;seb128&gt; right, that was discussed yesterday during the flavors sync call\n[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; (it's fine if they don't do LTS, of course)\n[20:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: oh ok - what's the news?\n[20:15] &lt;seb128&gt; someone took an action item to reach to Martin to ask\n[20:15] &lt;seb128&gt; but the few people who had feedback said that the MATE team seems mostly inactive recently\n[20:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok\n[20:16] &lt;seb128&gt; ah, someone was Mauro\n[20:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; that's fine then\n[20:16] &lt;seb128&gt; (just checked the meeting note)\n[20:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; I just didn't want this to slip by unnoticed\n[20:16] &lt;amurray&gt; there is a topic over in their discourse but I don't see anything definitive there\n[20:16] &lt;vorlon&gt; since the MATE team's communications preferences seem misaligned with the Release Team's and the Tech Board's these days\n[20:16] &lt;amurray&gt; #link https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/plans-for-24-04-lts/27110/4\n[20:17] &lt;seb128&gt; amurray, right, I think that one was used as a basis for the claim that the dev team isn't responsive/around much recently\n[20:19] &lt;amurray&gt; I'll ask in that thread as well and tag Martin as well\n[20:19] &lt;seb128&gt; amurray, thanks (and maybe check first with Mauro if he already did since he took an action about it yesterday)\n[20:19] &lt;seb128&gt; well I mean reaching out to them\n[20:20] &lt;seb128&gt; though I guess a public post wouldn't hurt in any case\n[20:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; Martin *did* come to the Ubuntu Summit so it's not entirely moribund?\n[20:20] &lt;amurray&gt; yeah I think its fine for the TB to enquire for our own purposes - it would definitely be a shame for MATE to not be part of the LTS\n[20:20] &lt;vorlon&gt; again, it's fine if a flavor doesn't want to do LTS support\n[20:21] &lt;seb128&gt; right, well let's see what they reply\n[20:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; just don't want to make sure that's a conscious decision (or the outcome of an assessment of the flavor's capacity), not an accident of timing\n[20:21] &lt;vorlon&gt; s/don't//\n[20:21] &lt;amurray&gt; agreed\n[20:21] &lt;amurray&gt; thanks for raising it vorlon\n[20:22] &lt;amurray&gt; anything else?\n[20:22] &lt;vorlon&gt; nothing else here\n[20:22] &lt;seb128&gt; nothing from me\n[20:22] &lt;amurray&gt; easy - thanks folks\n[20:22] &lt;amurray&gt; #endmeeting\n[20:22] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 20:22:59 UTC.

That's just wrong, right?\n[16:19] &lt;enr0n&gt; At the very least it's inconsistent with the default sources described in https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/spec-apt-deb822-sources-by-default/29333\n[16:19] &lt;juliank&gt; Indeed\n[16:20] &lt;schopin&gt; Do we enable universe by default?\n[16:20] &lt;schopin&gt; On a new install, I mean.\n[16:20] &lt;waveform&gt; we used to\n[16:21] &lt;waveform&gt; there was an issue where they were disabled ...

adrien: do we need to get umockdev rebuilt? if so, make that happen.  or if we need to retest with --all-proposed, do that\n[16:38] &lt;ravikant_&gt; juliank: thanks\n[16:39] &lt;adrien&gt; vorlon: ack, thanks\n[16:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; adrien: ah you said the build fails.

At this point, I am looking for anything to make it easier.\n[21:03] &lt;sarnold&gt; wuzamarine: hah, yeah, i'm familiar with that .. ipfwadm was easy enough but then they introduced ipchains. ipchains was annoying so I switched to ipf. then ipf was replaced with pf. then just when I was starting to learn ipchains they introduced iptables. and then just when I was getting around to learning iptables they introduced nftables. who even knows how long this one is going to last..\n[21:11] &lt;JanC&gt; ufw has been good enough for what I need recently, but almost a couple decades ago I used shorewall; no idea how it compares nowadays...\n[21:11] &lt;JanC&gt; and there are other tools/frontends too\n[21:12] &lt;JanC&gt; even ufw might work for what you are trying to do, but it's been a long time since I did anything complicated with it...   :)\n[21:14] &lt;JanC&gt; certainly port 25 just works for me...\n[21:17] &lt;JanC&gt; (but it's probably a different ufw version)\n[21:18] &lt;JanC&gt; are you certain fail2ban or knockd aren't causing your issues?\n\n# UBUNTU-MEETING\n\n=== flexiondotorg is now known as Wimpy\n\n</content></entry><entry><id>05.03.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</id><title>05.03.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><updated>2024-06-09T19:08:07.704746+00:00</updated><content># UBUNTU-SECURITY\n\n=== chris14_ is now known as chris14\n=== ChanServ changed the topic of #ubuntu-security to: Twitter: @ubuntu_sec || https://usn.ubuntu.com || https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam || https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features || Community: mdeslaur\n[11:25] &lt;frickler&gt; mdeslaur: ^^ twitter is gone, how about some nice mastodon acc instead?\n[12:08] &lt;ebarretto&gt; amurray, fyi too ^ \n=== ChanServ changed the topic of #ubuntu-security to: Mastodon: @ubuntusecurity@fosstodon.org || https://usn.ubuntu.com || https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam || https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features || Community: mdeslaur\n[12:10] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; ask, and you shall receive :)\n[12:10] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; hrm, should I write Fediverse there, or is Mastodon appropriate?\n[12:12] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; I guess Mastodon is ok until others become more popular\n[12:32] &lt;frickler&gt; wow, that was fast, thx :)\n[12:35] &lt;mdeslaur&gt; frickler: np :)\n[15:55] &lt;JanC&gt; it *is* Mastodon, so calling it Mastodon can't wrong  :)\n=== JanC is now known as Guest3312\n=== JanC_ is now known as JanC\n\n# UBUNTU-MEETING\n\n=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk\n[15:30] &lt;sarnold&gt; good morning\n[15:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hey\n[15:31] &lt;eslerm_&gt; greetings from 34k" over the dakotas o/\n[15:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; noble is completely time_t'ed - let us see how that looks in the reports\n[15:31] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #startmeeting Weekly Main Inclusion Requests status\n[15:31] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 15:31:53 UTC.

Is this expected to only have gcr4 at some point, if so when?\n[15:46] &lt;slyon&gt; I'd assume that depends on GTK3 usage in main..?\n[15:47] &lt;jbicha&gt; I can't give you an exact time since seahorse &amp; shotwell are undermaintained &amp; porting to gtk4 is a lot for big apps\n[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I see, so it really is once all GTK3 in main are gone some day\n[15:47] &lt;jbicha&gt; the old gcr will be in universe for a long time\n[15:47] &lt;jbicha&gt; yes\n[15:47] &lt;seb128&gt; hey there, sorry I wanted to join but I've another call at the same time and forgot to /j on IRC\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm personally fine with that TBH\n[15:48] &lt;seb128&gt; jbicha, thanks for covering for desktop :)\n[15:48] &lt;slyon&gt; Considering it's a versioned transition and we have precedence for parallel GTK3 &amp; GTK4 I'm +1 on promoting this. But I'd like to defer to cpaelzer and/or didrocks for a final decision, with their AA hats on\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm +1 as well, with a twist (not too bad one, let me write ...)\n[15:49] &lt;didrocks&gt; I donât think thatâs much different from gtk3 -&gt; gtk4. It would have been a good time for reviewing the package and how we can improve it, but I donât think this is doable in a realistic timeframe\n[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I haven't had a look, but is it reasonable to ask for improved testing and quality\n[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; otherwise we have to wait for GTK5  :-)\n[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; OTOH I totally see hwo time runs out for that\n[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; given that it is the same as before but newer I'm +1 even without, but couldn't resist asking for some QA and testing eyes\n[15:50] &lt;slyon&gt; Let's make improved/non-superficial autopkgtest a recommendation, then?\n[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: yeah, that\n[15:50] &lt;seb128&gt; +1, we can card that on our backlog, not going to happen for feature freeze though :)\n[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that is ok as a compromise - if it is before final freeze (vs the backlog being 234235346345 items long)\n[15:51] &lt;slyon&gt; I updated the case on LP. status: Fix Committed\n[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks\n[15:52] &lt;slyon&gt; #topic Incomplete bugs / questions\n[15:52] &lt;slyon&gt; Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams\n[15:52] &lt;slyon&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/?field.searchtext=&amp;orderby=-date_last_updated&amp;field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITH_RESPONSE&amp;field.status%3Alist=INCOMPLETE_WITHOUT_RESPONSE&amp;field.subscriber=ubuntu-mir\n[15:52] &lt;slyon&gt; bug #2023971\n[15:52] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2023971 in libmail-dmarc-perl (Ubuntu) "[MIR] libmail-dmarc-perl" [High, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2023971\n[15:53] &lt;slyon&gt; seems to be a tracking update (cc joalif)\n[15:53] &lt;slyon&gt; bug #2051850\n[15:53] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2051850 in trace-cmd (Ubuntu) "[MIR] trace-cmd" [Undecided, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2051850\n[15:54] &lt;slyon&gt; here we're waiting on implementation of required TODOs by foundations\n[15:54] &lt;slyon&gt; bug #2051916\n[15:54] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2051916 in libtraceevent (Ubuntu) "[MIR] promote libtraceevent as a trace-cmd dependency" [Undecided, Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2051916\n[15:54] &lt;eslerm&gt; (I'm planning to do the trace-cmd audit early)\n[15:54] &lt;slyon&gt; I've been working with upils actively to move this forward.

Considering that things are moving in the right direction (security review progressing, upstream work on the dbus-run-session equivalent), I was just wondering if there are any plans to make that switch for 24.04?\n[16:26] &lt;seb128&gt; I would love to see that happen but it doesn't seem like things align enough for it?\n[16:26] &lt;slyon&gt; seb128: I think most recent discussions (from last week? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dbus-broker/+bug/2015538/comments/19) revealed that we'd be willing to have it split into individual binary packages. So that src:dbus and src:dbus-broker could be in main at the same time, but only with the relevant binary packages (dbus-broker daemon + dbus policy)\n[16:26] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2015538 in dbus-broker (Ubuntu) "[MIR] dbus-broker" [Undecided, Incomplete]\n[16:28] &lt;seb128&gt; slyon, we had that discussion at the time we had the first review round iirc, but someone pointed out (mdeslaur?) back then that dbus-run-session depends on the dbus service\n[16:28] &lt;seb128&gt; I didn't have the free slots to read the code to see if that's true\n[16:28] &lt;seb128&gt; but assuming that's a true fact it means we can't do the split/demote dbus service thing\n[16:29] &lt;seb128&gt; if I understand correctly what you want to split (dbus-session-run in main, dbus in universe, right?)\n[16:31] &lt;slyon&gt; I think the idea was to get the upstream dbus-broker dbus-run-session equivalent integrated, so that we could demote dbus and dbus-run-session to universe, while keeping the src:dbus policy bits, which are not shipped by dbus-broker on purpose.\n[16:31] &lt;slyon&gt; But doing that split and integration work would need somebody with capacity to drive it\n[16:33] &lt;slyon&gt; comment #17 also suggest that there is no such hard dependency, which would give even more options: "In Debian we just keep both, dbus-run-session from the src:dbus package works just fine, and it can be installed in parallel without any issues when somebody needs it. So it doesn't seem to me that you need that separate implementation?"\n[16:33] &lt;slyon&gt; But it needs checking the details\n[16:35] &lt;seb128&gt; slyon, ack, thanks for the details\n[16:35] &lt;seb128&gt; it's on my backlog, I doubt I will get to it this week though but I'm still interested, maybe we manage to squeeze a ffe next week for it if things turn out to not be too complicated\n[16:36] &lt;seb128&gt; the fact that the new binary is written in rust is annoying it means it's not a simple patch to drop it\n[17:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: I could demote it, but this needs an extra exclude or it would come just back\n[17:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: it only has https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu-seeds/+git/ubuntu/tree/supported#n214\n[18:05] &lt;slyon&gt; cpaelzer: good catch!

Hopefully that's helpful, though with Gunnar gone I'm not sure who's left :-(\n[20:11] &lt;vorlon&gt; the thread had gone in that direction but maybe we just need to have that information available and don't need to consider it a blocker?\n[20:11] &lt;sgmoore&gt; I know we need a proper packageset, but other than that, how are we looking :) I am working hard on getting a spectacular release ready :)\n[20:11] &lt;vorlon&gt; rbasak: :/\n[20:13] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, I think I'm the only standing member left to deal with some of those translations things :/\n[20:14] &lt;seb128&gt; I need to sort that out somehow and find other people to involve\n[20:14] &lt;seb128&gt; if anyone is reading and want to help with translations please msg me\n[20:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; sgmoore: so I guess amurray who isn't here today was on point for driving the Kubuntu discussion.  I'll work on getting my action item sorted one way or the other so we can have a sane conversation about a packageset. From my perspective personally, that shouldn't be a blocker for LTS qualification but amurray will need to call the vote\n[20:15] &lt;sil2100&gt; The only thing I can commit to, sadly, is operating the machinery\n[20:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; seb128: IMHO, you should "close" those MLs and venues and bring everything into one place - ubuntu-devel@, or Discourse. It's not like we're going to be swarmed by traffic. Otherwise everyone assumes that there's a team somewhere that's running just fine.\n[20:15] &lt;sgmoore&gt; vorlon: Fair enough :)\n[20:16] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, the issue is that those lists are contact point for role-accounts on launchpad\n[20:17] &lt;sil2100&gt; sgmoore: out of curiosity, maybe composing a list of packages that you and your team worked on in the last 6 months when working on Kubuntu would be a start\n[20:17] &lt;sgmoore&gt; I only just started back with Kubuntu a few weeks ago.\n[20:17] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, I could set e.g devel but that doesn't resolve the issue than in practice the only admin in the team able to do the action is me\n[20:18] &lt;seb128&gt; (or maybe launchpad admins or some other admin groups, I don't remember the details and didn't go check)\n[20:18] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; sgmoore: I'll happily walk through UDD with you if you find it helpful :)\n[20:18] &lt;sgmoore&gt; I find any new knowledge helpful lol\n[20:19] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Okay, will follow up with you after the meeting\n[20:19] &lt;sgmoore&gt; sounds good thanks!\n[20:20] &lt;sil2100&gt; Okay, any other business?\n[20:21] &lt;sil2100&gt; Out of curiosity, with part of my release team hat on...\n[20:22] &lt;seb128&gt; nothing from me\n[20:22] &lt;sil2100&gt; Does anyone have contact with the Ubuntu Mate developers?\n[20:22] &lt;seb128&gt; sort of\n[20:23] &lt;vorlon&gt; it doesn't appear they've applied yet for 24.04 LTS qual\n[20:23] &lt;sil2100&gt; Just asking since I noticed they were a bit absent from .4\n[20:23] &lt;sil2100&gt; Anyway, guess that's not a TB-topic per-se\n[20:24] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic Select a chair for the next meeting\n[20:24] &lt;seb128&gt; I will give a ping to Martin just to ask\n[20:25] &lt;sil2100&gt; ...okay, how is this chair selection working\n[20:25] &lt;sil2100&gt; Since none of the sorting of TB members results in the current order for me\n[20:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; https://launchpad.net/~techboard/+members lists you last and Alex next after wrapping around\n[20:26] &lt;seb128&gt; sil2100, you got rescheduled for missing your previous chair so that confused the logical order\n[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Yes, so how come rbasak was the backup today\n[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Aaah\n[20:26] &lt;seb128&gt; :)\n[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Okay, so next chair will be amurray, backup rbasak\n[20:27] &lt;sil2100&gt; Thank you everyone!\n[20:27] &lt;sil2100&gt; #endmeeting\n[20:27] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 20:27:16 UTC.

We'll probably have the same version backported to older LTS (I assume)... so an follow-up MIR for older LTS should be easy\n[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; was looking if that adds any special issues\n[15:58] &lt;sarnold&gt; cpaelzer: wsl currently plays no part in any of the testing anywhere in the companym, as far as I can tell: there's no britney, none of the security team tests have ever been tested in wsl, etc. it's always felt like a "well, if it works, that's neat" sort of thing\n[15:58] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; like, dependencies or the context no more working\n[15:59] &lt;sarnold&gt; cpaelzer: it's weird to me to be considering selling pro for wsl without having the basic testing story covered\n[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and then we have said "this is ok, also for those releases"\n[15:59] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: this is for pro in wsl as you say, and that is actually tested daily and on any change by the Desktop team owning this agent and by the pro team it is tested as well from the other POV to this\n[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; pro on wsl, does not make this story any different\n[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we could also say we need tests on each cloud, each container stack, ... then\n[16:00] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but we do not\n[16:00] &lt;eslerm&gt; I believe security can proceed with only Nobel in mind (a conditional ack for just 24.04 if needed) while this is all worked out\n[16:00] &lt;sarnold&gt; can windows execute systemd yet?\n[16:01] &lt;sarnold&gt; as far as I know, the clouds can, and some of the containers do, some do not..\n[16:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; to be clear, you can have a lot of things in WSL already, even pro works there. But it isn't called that way and this makes it able to enable it more smoothly.\n[16:01] &lt;slyon&gt; sarnold: I remember helping with systemd support for wsl in the past, so probably yes\n[16:01] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes, it can in some environments\n[16:02] &lt;sarnold&gt; I seem to recall lucy making it work, but does the thing that we or microsoft ship work?\n[16:02] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it isn't as bad as you might think :-)\n[16:02] &lt;sarnold&gt; I think comparing it to a new architecture is perhaps the better comparison\n[16:02] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but again, this request is only for an agent that makes enabling pro possible in smoother ways\n[16:02] &lt;sarnold&gt; sure\n[16:03] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is not "let us create Ubuntu for WSL, what should we do"\n[16:03] &lt;sarnold&gt; I'm asking the larger question\n[16:03] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; those are questions to be asked, but not as part of this MIR\n[16:03] &lt;sarnold&gt; cpaelzer: just promise me that someone is asking these questions of the right people\n[16:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: you send me a mail summarize with what you want to be asked and I make it happen\n[16:04] &lt;sarnold&gt; cpaelzer: awesome, thanks :)\n[16:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I have quite some ties to many people, probably all that need to hear that\n[16:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok\n[16:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thank you all, I need to close\n[16:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm too late already ...\n[16:04] &lt;sarnold&gt; thanks cpaelzer, all :)\n[16:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks++\n[16:04] &lt;eslerm&gt; thanks everyone o/\n[16:04] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #endmeeting\n[16:04] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 16:04:50 UTC.

What package versions string would you expect to use for your upload?\n[19:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; *package version string\n[19:13] &lt;vpa1977&gt; It depends if it is Ubuntu specific or debian package. For ubuntu it will be 1.2.1-0ubuntu1 for debian it will be 1.2.1~us1-0ubuntu1\n[19:13] &lt;vpa1977&gt; reason for ~us1 is that original tarballs are not reproducible in some cases\n[19:13] &lt;vpa1977&gt; and the repack suffix will allow sync with debian\n[19:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; Good answer :)\n[19:14] &lt;vpa1977&gt; (not reproducible e.g. when used xz compression)\n[19:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let me move on to transitions\n[19:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; In the usual case, how would you verify if an upload you're considering making would introduce a transition or not?\n[19:15] &lt;vpa1977&gt; The transition will happen when there are API/ABI changes in the package providing a build dependency (e.g. time_t)\n[19:15] &lt;vpa1977&gt; Or the toolchain changes such as Java 21\n[19:16] &lt;vpa1977&gt; *build or runtime dependency\n[19:17] &lt;vpa1977&gt; In this case all dependant package will need to migrate together to ensure that there are no breaks\n[19:17] &lt;sil2100&gt; I'll have an unrelated question when you're done\n[19:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let's say that the package is src:foo, which generates binary package libfoo1. You're about to update a new major version of src:foo, and you have a test build ready in a PPA. Is there something you can see easily by inspection from the web UI that would instantly tell you if there's an ABI break if this is a normal case with nothing special going on?\n[19:19] &lt;vpa1977&gt; From the web UI i can the major version change, but I would be looking at reverse-depends and reverse-depends -b to see if it has any dependencies\n[19:19] &lt;vpa1977&gt; and rebuild those /autopkgtest in the ppa\n[19:19] &lt;vpa1977&gt; I apologise if I am taking the long route here.\n[19:19] &lt;vpa1977&gt; But library bumping a major version indicates some kind of break\n[19:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; It doesn't necessarily mean it's an ABI break.\n[19:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; What would be the difference, in terms of binary packages generated?\n[19:21] &lt;vpa1977&gt; Meaning what constitutes the ABI break? Change of function parameters, removal of a function\n[19:21] &lt;vpa1977&gt; Change of the exported structures\n[19:21] &lt;rbasak&gt; Assume that it is correctly declared by the packaging\n[19:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; What would be externally visible in the packaging that would indicate the ABI break?\n[19:22] &lt;vpa1977&gt; as in from launchpad UI ?\n[19:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm suggesting that it's possible to see from Launchpad web UI what I'm asking for, yes.\n[19:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; Assuming you have a PPA test build ready\n[19:24] &lt;vpa1977&gt; hmm... I fail to answer that ;( without looking inside package / at the sources ;(\n[19:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK let's move on.\n[19:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; sil2100: you said you had a question?\n[19:25] &lt;vpa1977&gt; (please share the answer later =) )\n[19:25] &lt;sil2100&gt; Yes, I had an SRU related question!\n[19:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; I see that you did do a few SRUs, but I just want to make sure. When requesting an SRU, the template requires putting a "Where problems could occur"/"Regression Potential" section\n[19:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Can you tell me what is the purpose of it?\n[19:27] &lt;sil2100&gt; What do we want the SRU requesters to do as part of the preparation of this section?\n[19:28] &lt;teward&gt; *shows up late*\n[19:28] &lt;teward&gt; (I had no internet until now sorry, technician was on site fixing the fiber link)\n[19:28] &lt;vladimirp&gt; sorry disconnect\n[19:29] &lt;vladimirp&gt; Not sure if the answer got through : the section identifies extended test plan that tries to identify possible regressions/impact on users due to the change\n[19:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; Thanks o/\n[19:30] &lt;sil2100&gt; I have no further questions\n[19:31] &lt;kanashiro&gt; all the answers so far and the endorsements are enough for me to vote\n[19:32]  * rbasak is pondering whether he has further questions\n[19:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; vladimirp: let's say that an upload might have resulted in a component mismatch. Where would you confirm whether this is the case or not, and what are the options available to resolve a component mismatch?\n[19:33] &lt;vladimirp&gt; Lets say I have introduced a dependency on main package which is currently in universe.\n[19:34] &lt;vladimirp&gt; In this case I will need to go through MIR process first to move my dependency from universe to main before uploading the package.\n[19:34] &lt;vladimirp&gt; I can rollback the change by uploading the fix that removes the dependency (if possible)\n[19:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK, thanks.\n[19:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm ready to vote.\n[19:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; teward: do you have any questions?\n[19:35] &lt;teward&gt; nope, on account you and others have asked the questions I had :)\n[19:35] &lt;teward&gt; and also apologies for my being late, I hate being late but when I have no internet...\n[19:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; #vote Grant Vladimir Petko core dev\n[19:36] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Grant Vladimir Petko core dev\n[19:36] &lt;meetingology&gt; Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')\n[19:36] &lt;sil2100&gt; +1\n[19:36] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from sil2100\n[19:36] &lt;kanashiro&gt; +1\n[19:36] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from kanashiro\n[19:36] &lt;teward&gt; +1\n[19:36] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from teward\n[19:38] &lt;rbasak&gt; +1 I think a couple of answers fell a little short of my expectations, but your endorsements speak well of your tendency to be thoughful and ask questions before acting.

Thank you!\n[19:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; tsimonq2: I don't know if you're aware of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RobieBasak/DMB/CoreDev\n[19:50] &lt;rbasak&gt; That's just my opinion - I think we were hoping to try and get that adjusted according DMB consensus and then share that more widely.\n[19:50] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; rbasak: Nope, but now I am :D this is meant to be a shorter reference anyway, with links to something like that.\n[19:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; That would be fine I think. The issue (at the DMB end) is that we vary in opinion, but that makes it hard for applicants.\n[19:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; It'd be nice to find/negotiate common ground, tweaking as necessary, and have an official DMB opinion.\n[19:51] &lt;rbasak&gt; Anyway, thank you again for working on this.\n[19:51] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I documented this for Lubuntu a while back: https://git.lubuntu.me/lubuntu-wiki/wiki/wiki/lubuntu-dev - might be worth exploring.\n[19:51] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; rbasak: I completely agree :) thanks for considering it!\n[19:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; Indeed - that looks like it'd be useful input to a final DMB opinion too!\n[19:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; Anything else on this to discuss for now?\n[19:52] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I'm good if you all are good :)\n[19:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; Any other business?\n[19:54] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; vpa1977 wanted to know the answer to the question about transitions that rbasak asked?\n[19:54] &lt;rbasak&gt; The binary package generated would have changed from libfoo1 to libfoo2. That's what triggers a "normal" transition - libfoo1 would become uninstallable (and/or NBS) were the package to migrate.\n[19:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; Though I think vladimirp might have already understood this and it was just a mismatch in communication!\n[19:55] &lt;rbasak&gt; I find it quite hard to phrase questions to avoid that sort of thing, without giving away my expected answers.\n[19:55] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; which is exactly what happened to me when you hit me with a near-identical question last January\n[19:56] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; :P\n[19:56] &lt;vladimirp&gt; I was thinking - I have a package to review and needs to find if it contains an ABI break.\n[19:56] &lt;vladimirp&gt; Could have mentioned abi-compliance-checker (but its a nightmare)\n[19:57] &lt;vladimirp&gt; Plus C++ only\n[19:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; arraybolt3: indeed :)\n[19:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; I guess the meeting's done though then?\n[19:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; #endmeeting\n[19:57] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 19:57:47 UTC.

Many assumptions can be made through reviewing debdiffs, but until there is something clear saying "this is a MOTU, this is a Core Dev," the DMB has a large amount of flexibility on what it can ask.\n[20:06] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Now, I'm not suggesting we go full Debian Developer and have pre-written questions. There should, however, be something saying "these are the kinds of questions you can expect."\n[20:07] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; If there's one thing I've heard from candidates privately that sticks out, it is "I'm scared for the meeting because they could ask anything," and quite honestly, that's the truth. As an existing Ubuntu Developer, it's fun to see, but I remember it being a very anxiety-prone process to go through.\n[20:08] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; That was the catalyst for writing that reference document above, to get something solid started on this front, to benefit every applicant that comes after Vladimir.\n=== _doko is now known as doko\n\n</content></entry><entry><id>18.02.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</id><title>18.02.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><updated>2024-06-09T19:08:07.691509+00:00</updated><content># UBUNTU-SECURITY\n\n=== JanC is now known as Guest2833\n=== JanC_ is now known as JanC\n\n# UBUNTU-MEETING\n\n=== JanC is now known as Guest2833\n=== JanC_ is now known as JanC\n\n</content></entry><entry><id>17.02.2024: ubuntu-security</id><title>17.02.2024: ubuntu-security</title><updated>2024-06-09T19:08:07.690599+00:00</updated><content># UBUNTU-SECURITY\n\n=== chris14_ is now known as chris14\n[13:35] &lt;rouca&gt; eslerm: any news of sendmail ?\n[14:37] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/resources-for-development-related-tasks/42544 :)\n=== wete_ is now known as wete\n\n</content></entry><entry><id>16.02.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</id><title>16.02.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><updated>2024-06-09T19:08:07.689712+00:00</updated><content># UBUNTU-SECURITY\n\n=== chris14_ is now known as chris14\n=== chris14_ is now known as chris14\n=== JanC is now known as Guest6865\n=== JanC_ is now known as JanC\n\n# UBUNTU-MEETING\n\n=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk\n=== JanC is now known as Guest6865\n=== JanC_ is now known as JanC\n\n</content></entry><entry><id>15.02.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</id><title>15.02.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><updated>2024-06-09T19:08:07.688765+00:00</updated><content># UBUNTU-SECURITY\n\n=== chris14_ is now known as chris14\n[08:53] &lt;rouca&gt; eslerm: just send you a patch\n[08:54] &lt;rouca&gt; eslerm: forget to mention it was against bookworm\n=== JanC is now known as Guest1755\n=== JanC_ is now known as JanC\n\n# UBUNTU-MEETING\n\n=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk\n=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk\n=== JanC is now known as Guest1755\n=== JanC_ is now known as JanC\n=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk\n=== rkratky__ is now known as rkratky\n[16:01] &lt;juliank&gt; #startmeeting Weekly Ubuntu Foundations team\n[16:01] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 16:01:26 UTC.

please retrigger?\n[16:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; or reopen / fix better :)\n[16:25] &lt;Skia&gt; bdmurray: to have someone else look at this? did I misunderstood something?\n[16:26] &lt;schopin&gt; vorlon: I split the card in two (investigation vs implementation) as requested by Ravi (or Samir?) as the implementation is substantial.\n[16:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; I don't see mention of python3-defaults vs booth being assigned previously. bdmurray: let's give this to Tim\n[16:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; schopin: so do you have the "implementation" card assigned to you and in this pulse?\n[16:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; you do\n[16:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; sorry for missing it\n[16:27] &lt;schopin&gt; No worries.\n[16:27] &lt;Skia&gt; vorlon: I think the preliminary investigation pointed that to also being the fault of crmsh, but that would require confirmation\n[16:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; Skia: "that"?\n[16:27] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Skia: I just prefer precision as opposed to it and its that are misinterpretable.\n[16:27] &lt;Skia&gt; vorlon: booth vs python3-defaults\n[16:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; Skia: ok well I think it should still be investigated in parallel given the time constraints\n[16:28] &lt;Skia&gt; sure\n[16:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; python3 vs dolfin/dolfinx-mpc I understand is with ginggs\n[16:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; + fenics-dolfinx\n[16:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; and possibly the Miami Dolphins\n[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; and the French dauphin\n[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; gpiozero is with WaVeR\n[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; no\n[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; gpiozero is with waveform\n[16:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; I'm gonna try to go fast here to get to the new stuff so please yell if any of these need to be handed off otherwise I'm assuming the current assignments are good and on track for resolution by next Thu\n[16:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; which NEEDS TO HAPPEN so we can get the python3 transition through and make room for other stuff before DebianImportFreeze\n[16:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; jupyter-notebook is dbungert\n[16:30] &lt;ginggs&gt; i believe gpiozero is fixed\n[16:30] &lt;dbungert&gt; correct, I expect that done today\n[16:30] &lt;waveform&gt; gpiozero should be fixed by the 2.0.1 upload this morning, so I'm free for another\n[16:30] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; I have looked at python-werkzeug vs onionshare before\n[16:30]  * juliank prefers to chase down all his gnupg 2.4 regressions fwiw\n[16:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; python3-defaults vs lamassemble is not listed as currently assigned; adrien please take?\n[16:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; libapache2-mod-python is with dviererbe\n[16:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; meson is with mkukri\n[16:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; passenger is with mateus-morais\n[16:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; pyflakes is not previously assigned; bdrung please\n[16:32] &lt;bdrung&gt; ack\n[16:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; pygrib is not previously assigned; bdmurray please\n[16:32] &lt;bdmurray&gt; blah\n[16:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-ansible-compat - schopin do you know offhand if this is related to the other ansible stuff and should be included\n[16:33] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I think I added it to big_packages with no success\n[16:33] &lt;schopin&gt; vorlon: dunno but sounds likely.\n[16:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-ansible-compat: schopin but if it's unrelated please feel free to raise a flag to get it broken out to someone ele\n[16:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; +s\n[16:34] &lt;adrien&gt; I like that proposed migrations leads one to discover new packages (very often scientific ones surprisingly :) )\n[16:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-django-debug-toolbar assigned to rkratky\n[16:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; also python-django-extensions\n[16:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-mitogen assigned to enr0n_\n[16:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; all, please commit time as soon as possible to get these fixed so the release team doesn't have to chase them over the next week to get python3-defaults migrated\n[16:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-oauth2client is with ogayot\n[16:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; python-hug is "waiting" for an i386 autopkgtest, I'll look at that\n[16:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; coreutils: this was a security team upload now stalled. cpete please?\n[16:36] &lt;cpete&gt; ack\n[16:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; glib2.0 is entwined w/ python3-defaults indirectly via gobject-introspection\n[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; dpkg: xypron please\n[16:37] &lt;xypron&gt; ok\n[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; glibc: schopin do you have this, do you need any release team support?\n[16:38] &lt;schopin&gt; I have this, I'll ask for hinting as all actual regressions are already carded and scheduled for investigation post FF (too much to land beforehand)\n[16:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; "waiting" for feature-check&gt; this has gone awol and doesn't even show on update_excuses.html, I'll retrigger\n[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; llvm-toolchain-14 vs pygments: juliank please\n[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: make that pygments as a whole please\n[16:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; there's also llvm-toolchain-14 vs protobuf: slyon ?\n[16:41] &lt;slyon&gt; ok\n[16:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; have just retriggered missing tests for dh-cargo; ginggs please give that to me explicitly for follow-up\n[16:41] &lt;ginggs&gt; vorlon: ack\n[16:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; tzdata: upils?\n[16:41] &lt;bdrung&gt; i'll take tzdata\n[16:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok\n[16:42] &lt;upils&gt; oh ok\n[16:42] &lt;bdrung&gt; tzdata just needs some tests retriggered\n[16:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; pushkarnk: do you want to *continue* looking at python-werkzeug vs onionshare or do you want someone else to take this?\n[16:42] &lt;pushkarnk&gt; I can continue\n[16:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok\n[16:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; and that's the list\n[16:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; thanks\n[16:43] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank:\n[16:44] &lt;bdrung&gt; vorlon, apport 2.27.0-0ubuntu7 is in the new queue (for the new binary package (for systemd-coredump support)). can you have a look?\n[16:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; bdrung: ack will look\n[16:44] &lt;juliank&gt; #topic AOB\n[16:44] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Monday is a US holiday\n[16:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; ginggs: btw adios2 is also blocked by fenics-dolfinx and blocks python3-defaults\n[16:45] &lt;ginggs&gt; vorlon: ack\n[16:45] &lt;vorlon&gt; ginggs: also slepc4py :)\n[16:46] &lt;vorlon&gt; and the last thing I can see right now from update_excuses that's not assigned wrt python3-defaults is unity ftbfs on armhf\n[16:46] &lt;vorlon&gt; ah due to a builder going away\n[16:46] &lt;vorlon&gt; so retriggered\n[16:47] &lt;juliank&gt; #endmeeting\n[16:47] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 16:47:38 UTC.

let us cheeck\n[15:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; they are approved at least by the color\n[15:32] &lt;slyon&gt; yes, that's what I did earlier today :)\n[15:32] &lt;slyon&gt; besides those, kexec-tools looks new to me\n[15:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yes, they can be promoted\n[15:32] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'll do so tomorrow if no one beats me to it\n[15:32] &lt;slyon&gt; thanks!\n[15:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; i'm surprised the kexec-tools owner is ~canonical-ubuntu-qa\n[15:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; I expected kernel team ;)\n[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it is the kernel team\n[15:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; (maybe foundations..)\n[15:33] &lt;slyon&gt; It shows ~kernel-packages for me\n[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/m-r-package-team-mapping.html\n[15:33] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; some are subscribed by multiple which breaks some checks\n[15:33] &lt;sarnold&gt; aha\n[15:34] &lt;slyon&gt; but yes, QA is subscribed, too\n[15:34] &lt;sarnold&gt; I was going by bug subscribers https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kexec-tools\n[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this is added in kexec-tools (1:2.0.25-1)\n[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;   * Added build dependency on libxen-dev so kexec would work on xen\n[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;     (Closes: #1023270)\n[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the merge didn't revert that change and made it Ubuntu delta kexec-tools (1:2.0.28-0ubuntu1)\n[15:34] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but probably needs to\n[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; We lack a kernel person to ping\n[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; let me see who uploaded that ...\n[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kexec-tools/1:2.0.28-0ubuntu1\n[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; xnox: did\n[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hi xnox, do you think we should remove the recommends to xen from kexec-tools or do you want to pursue this in any other way?\n[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; The rest of the component mismatches are known cases that are being worked on or false-positives\n[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

There are two more from the production/crisis-tools set\n[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we last week consumed three of them, some already done some still in flight\n[15:37] &lt;slyon&gt; I can take one of the desktop MIRs\n[15:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; handing you the snapshot\n[15:38] &lt;slyon&gt; ack\n[15:39] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hmm\n[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hard to spread the others\n[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; jamespage: can I pass you one as well today?\n[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; to balance the load?\n[15:40] &lt;eslerm&gt; bpf bugs mention they are WIP, but the outstanding issues seemed small enough that I encourged submitting them (missing unit tests)\n[15:40] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; joalif: seems not to be here yet but last week had already a second assigned - so probably full too\n[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I completed mine this morning (last minutes)\n[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; There are two ways we can do this\n[15:41] &lt;eslerm&gt; I wouldn't mind foing a review for the MIR team if that is okay\n[15:41] &lt;eslerm&gt; doing*\n[15:41] &lt;joalif&gt; sorry I am here but at 2 mtgs in teh same time and didnt say hi\n[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hehe\n[15:41] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; np joalif, how possible or not is it to take another reivew?\n[15:41] &lt;joalif&gt; If you cannot find anyone else assign a bug to me but then again no promises for next week\n[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; joalif: as long as not all of them are piling up and are done never it is ok to take a while each\n[15:42] &lt;jamespage&gt; cpaelzer: yep\n[15:42] &lt;joalif&gt; ok then\n[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I assigned langtable to joalif\n[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; thanks jamespage - giving you bpftrace\n[15:42] &lt;joalif&gt; ack\n[15:42] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and myself taking bpfcc\n[15:43] &lt;jamespage&gt; ta\n[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; That clears the list\n[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; to all of us, good luck in finding an efficient review time\n[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; #topic Incomplete bugs / questions\n[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; Mission: Identify required actions and spread the load among the teams\n[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

ok we see the libtrace* things going back\n[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; mostly being great and ok actually, but missing some better QA\n[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; one done by didrocks, one by me\n[15:45] &lt;slyon&gt; cc upils: ^\n[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; slyon: of the team prefers, there is the option to do autopkgtests once and awesome just on the high level\n[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I suggested to that in my review\n[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; like\n[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; a) get the build time tests to be better, seems didrocks found the same in his review\n[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but also\n[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; b) autopkgtests are weak\n[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but for (b)\n[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; that can be done in-pkg\n[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; or it can be done on the level that pulls it in, which here is trace-cmd\n[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; there is might be easier to write non trivial tests\n[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and if made sure that this uses both libs, that might be adressing 3-for-1\n[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; all other incomplete cases in this list are much older\n[15:47] &lt;slyon&gt; right. This is for upils to look into. Potentially doing proper autopkgtests for trace-cmd only\n[15:47] &lt;sarnold&gt; tracing the autopkgtest runner kernels might be a challenge\n[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; yeah slyon, if done right that would cover all three at once\n[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; sarnold: we have testcases which spawn VMs to have control and avoid weird effects\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this could be another one of those\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; mark them big to have enough mem/cpu and set it up that way\n[15:48] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; o/ MIR team! Sorry to butt in, I just wanted to bring this to your attention: https://tracker.debian.org/news/1493585/accepted-ubuntu-dev-tools-0198-source-into-unstable/ - I am quite happy to accept any feedback if you have it. :)\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; not saing it has to be that way, but it helps to have control and avoid flakyness\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hi tsimonq2, you are totally fine to interrupt\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; having a look ...\n[15:49] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Those are just some slight tweaks I found useful for check-mir.

this is still ongoing\n[20:21] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; o/ I'm a stand-in for Kubuntu today, and just wanted to provide some context (nothing actionable.) Scarlett Gately Moore has been working for the Kubuntu Council now, officially, on a contract basis. I have been tasked with guiding her through so she re-learns the ropes. There has been enough progress and energy in the Kubuntu Team where I am confident in saying we should be re-qualified. I'm\n[20:21] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; happy to answer any specific questions if there are any today, because I have been deeply involved in this effort.\n[20:22] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Rik is still around and involved, providing guidance on the precedent he has set over the past few years, to be clear.\n[20:23] &lt;amurray&gt; hey tsimonq2 - at this stage I don't have any specific questions, I'll probably just continue to follow up via email - I did notice scarlett said they would intend to support the entire kubuntu packageset (which is great!) but I worry about whether they have the resources for this?\n[20:23] &lt;vorlon&gt; that all seems reasonable, and Kubuntu is established enough that I'm personally not worried about a change of lead impacting the LTS qual\n[20:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; amurray: could you elaborate as to what's in the kubuntu packageset that's not KDE?\n[20:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; we do a poor job of gardening packagesets\n[20:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; there's probably a bunch of stuff listed that doesn't even exist in the archive anymore\n[20:25] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; vorlon: I understand this isn't necessarily what we want to do going forward, but yes, that list has quite grown over time.\n[20:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; doesn't have to be done here and now, anyway; this could be a mail followup\n[20:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; but I'd like to get into the nitty-gritty of the capacity concerns\n[20:26] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Not a problem :)\n[20:26] &lt;amurray&gt; ok (fyi the packageset is quite long https://pastebin.ubuntu.com/p/jbYsvvfVgq/ so I assume the kubuntu folks might want to scope their statement of support a bit)\n[20:26] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think a flavour packageset is a poor list to use outside of DMB managed ACLs because they are (were) automatically produced\n[20:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/packagesets/noble/kubuntu btw\n[20:27] &lt;rbasak&gt; ...and they might change arbitrarily for the same sort of reason in the future\n[20:27] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; I'll follow up on our end to see if Rik had a particular rhyme or reason.\n[20:27] &lt;amurray&gt; ok, we'll continue this via email then\n[20:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; rbasak: unfortunately it's the best proxy we have for "things in this flavor that aren't also in a base seed" without additional coding that we've never bothered doing.  But I agree\n[20:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; tsimonq2: I look forward to you elaborating on your support plan for cvs\n[20:28] &lt;rbasak&gt; The task of fixing the scripts is years old and not taken now. The DMB currently just adjusts them manually on request.\n[20:28] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; vorlon: lol :)\n[20:28] &lt;rbasak&gt; So there's no longer really any assurance that packages in there aren't in a different seed. Nobody is checking for that.\n[20:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; uh you can give me an action to look whether we have any ubuntu-archive / ubuntu-release bits that would let me say "this bit is the flavor-specific overlay"\n[20:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; because what we want to see is set(kubuntu-seeds) - set(platform-seeds)\n[20:29] &lt;amurray&gt; #action vorlon to look into scripting for packages in flavor-specific overlays\n[20:29] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: vorlon to look into scripting for packages in flavor-specific overlays\n[20:30] &lt;amurray&gt; ACTION: vorlon to confirm ratification of Lubuntu LTS\n[20:30] &lt;amurray&gt; as noted above, this was already done\n[20:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; well. set(kubuntu-seeds) - set(platform-seeds) - set(ubuntu-seeds)\n[20:31] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic Scan the mailing list archive for anything we missed (standing item)\n[20:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; xnox asked for a change in LP\n[20:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; yes\n[20:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; which he pointed out that my previous request for apt maintainer sign-off was unfortunately on a superseded mp and thus "lost" to the stream\n[20:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; with my AA hat on I have 0 concerns about dropping this if apt itself doesn't use it\n[20:32] &lt;rbasak&gt; I wanted to know who would be taking responsibility for the change, dealing with any fallout, etc, and I don't think I got a clear answer to that.\n[20:32] &lt;amurray&gt; yep - I'm not sure how to proceed here - there is clearly some perceived risk in this change but its not clear to me who owns it\n[20:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; I will as an AA\n[20:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; give this to me as an action please\n[20:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; Great - thanks!\n[20:33] &lt;amurray&gt; thanks vorlon\n[20:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; (TBH I think despite the acl being owned by the TB this could have just been handled directly with the AA members of the TB rather than involving the TB as a whole)\n[20:33] &lt;amurray&gt; #action vorlon to follow up on xnox's request to set noble.publish_i18n_index to False\n[20:33] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: vorlon to follow up on xnox's request to set noble.publish_i18n_index to False\n[20:34] &lt;amurray&gt; I don't see anything else on the mailing list for today\n[20:34] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic Check up on community bugs and techboard bugs\n[20:34] &lt;amurray&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-community/+bugs?field.assignee=techboard\n[20:34] &lt;amurray&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/techboard\n[20:35] &lt;amurray&gt; nothing here either\n[20:35] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic Select a chair for the next meeting (next from https://launchpad.net/~techboard/+members)\n[20:35] &lt;amurray&gt; looks like its me and rbasak as backup\n[20:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; ack\n[20:35] &lt;amurray&gt; #agreed next meeting chair: amurray, backup: rbasak\n[20:35] &lt;meetingology&gt; AGREED: next meeting chair: amurray, backup: rbasak\n[20:36] &lt;amurray&gt; #topic AOB\n[20:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; o/\n[20:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; the covention is that it be sil2100 with rbasak as backup, but ok :)\n[20:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; +n\n[20:36] &lt;amurray&gt; oh cool\n[20:36] &lt;amurray&gt; #agreed next meeting chair: sil2100, backup: rbasak\n[20:36] &lt;meetingology&gt; AGREED: next meeting chair: sil2100, backup: rbasak\n[20:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; (i.e. missing your chair spot doesn't get you off the hook for chairing :)\n[20:37] &lt;amurray&gt; does anyone else have AOB? otherwise rbasak the floor is yours\n[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; This relates to "snap-MIRs" here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1apUKR4gtOrfPGCWmtoebaQUhoy-fG8Cyo3VKJyhnpD0/edit#heading=h.whx7oqqnxsv0\n[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; Our previous discussions are summarised and linked from there.

To make progress I'd like to: 1) decide if it really needs to be general, because if we can agree that it's snap-specific then we can progress on the main body at least; 2) meet in a higher bandwidth medium (Google Meet?) with amurray and maybe seb128, sil2100, whoever\n[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; else wants to be involved to actually get something drafted that works for us.\n[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; This might be homework for you for next time to remind yourself of the previous conversation, but maybe it's worth mentioning here in public that I'd like to resolve this out-of-band and come back with a result to present in public in order to get something into the draft that's workable for everyone. I'd still expect a final vote / ratification here in public regardless so I don't think there need\n[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; be any concerns about not being public enough with the work on this.\n[20:38] &lt;amurray&gt; sounds reasonable to me\n[20:38] &lt;vorlon&gt; +1\n[20:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; Thanks. I'll set up a meeting then. Anybody else who'd like to be involved, please contact me.\n[20:40] &lt;amurray&gt; we already have an action item on the agenda around this so I won't add any additional one\n[20:40] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, I had that action item but I'm happy for it to grab it if you have time to move that forward\n[20:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; seb128: I think that was on a different point - snap tracks?\n[20:41] &lt;amurray&gt; yeah we have 2 similar items on the agenda - one is about track usage and the other is about test plans for third-party apps - this is about the second one\n[20:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; We could try and combine them to make scheduling easier\n[20:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; Approximately the same set of people need to discuss them anyway\n[20:42] &lt;amurray&gt; sure\n[20:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; So you can leave it with me to schedule something\n[20:42] &lt;amurray&gt; thanks rbasak\n[20:42] &lt;seb128&gt; ah, right, sorry ... but yeah, might be more efficient to cover both topics in one meeting\n[20:42] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, thanks!\n[20:43] &lt;amurray&gt; anything else for today...?\n[20:43] &lt;vorlon&gt; nothing here\n[20:43] &lt;rbasak&gt; Nothing else from me.

Thanks\n[12:43] &lt;youngbin&gt; agreed we an setup bridge until all folks moved to matrix\n[12:43] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so lets follow up with Mauro, on that, and setup the bridge when we have the matrix channel\n[12:43] &lt;mapreri&gt; oh the topic of discourse, I think as council we should monitor ("watch") several boards - should we keep a list of somewhere of what all of us are supposed to monitor?\n[12:44] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes.. anyway since youngbin is active on matrix.. can have a quick chat anytime\n[12:44] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; mapreri: we should definitively, all those rellated with LoCo's\n[12:44] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; That is good idea mapreri.\n[12:44] &lt;mapreri&gt; like, apparently https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/locos/loco-support/156 + https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/locos/docs/130 + â¦ like the meeting agenda, that was posted in the mail board, but I don't want to subscribe that as it would notify for all suboards?\n[12:45] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Discourse.. keeping a list of pages is required I think for any loco team update tracking\n[12:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; maybe we can also do a regular report of LoCo activity, not just on discourse\n[12:45] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1\n[12:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; keep an eye also on the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter\n[12:46] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1\n[12:46] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; +1\n[12:47] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so we can mabe open a pad every week and contribute to it\n[12:47] &lt;youngbin&gt; discourse have notification so maybe we can just subscribe to category. loco report activity on other places also sounds good\n[12:47] &lt;mapreri&gt; DiogoConstantino: mhh, activity of what are you talking about, sorry?\n[12:47] &lt;mapreri&gt; of each loco?\n[12:47] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I would say anything we find relevant\n[12:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; it doesn't need to be all\n[12:48] &lt;mapreri&gt; mh, I fear you are too optimist :)\n[12:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; just the things we find more interesting\n[12:48] &lt;youngbin&gt; btw are we on "Review the LoCo (re)validation procedure" topic?\n[12:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; something different that a LoCo is doing\n[12:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; youngbin: not yet\n[12:48] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; :-D mapreri\n[12:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; still on communication\n[12:48] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Like ubucon updates for instance..\n[12:49] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; or some new iniciative\n[12:49] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1\n[12:49] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; an inovation\n[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so maybe we can come up with proposals for this\n[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; in writting\n[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; for next meeting\n[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and we vote on it\n[12:50] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Would love to have a discussion on structuring of loco teams some day\n[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; do you agree?\n[12:50] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1\n[12:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; +1\n[12:51] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok\n[12:51] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so also still regarding communication\n[12:51] &lt;youngbin&gt; so we're going to collect loco activities on pad?\n[12:52] &lt;kanashiro&gt; sorry guys, I had a last minute concurrent meeting but I am reading the backlog\n[12:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; youngbin: the idea is to come up with a proposal on what to do about it\n[12:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; a vote on it next month\n[12:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I feel the concept needs to be developed\n[12:53] &lt;mapreri&gt; my take on that is that my loco really has no such wide/interesting activities that are worth reporting monthlyâ¦ even yearly.  We are basically mostly carrying on.\n[12:53] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; that's what we want to change\n[12:53] &lt;mapreri&gt; so asking for "reports" is imho both a "push to actually do more interesting stuff" and "damn they want me to do paperwork"\n[12:53] &lt;mapreri&gt; not sure what wins of the two\n[12:53] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Can we send proposals and ideas on mailing list or do you prefer elsewhere?\n[12:54] &lt;kanashiro&gt; which mailing list?\n[12:54] &lt;mapreri&gt; indeed, this should be flashed out elsewhere, not in this meeting\n[12:54] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; there's a LoCo council mailing list\n[12:54] &lt;youngbin&gt; so i understand the purpose is that we want to have some insights of what locos are doing?\n[12:54] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; but let's put them on discourse\n[12:54] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; :)\n[12:55] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; mapreri\n[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I'll create a topic on that\n[12:55] &lt;mapreri&gt; ty\n[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and we can post it there\n[12:55] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Thanks\n[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; is it ok?\n[12:55] &lt;kanashiro&gt; I believe we first need to understand how healthy are the locos to then try to take any action to improve them, not sure if you guys have an idea about how locos are doing\n[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I have on some\n[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; not all\n[12:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; most are incipient at this point\n[12:56] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and some are letargic\n[12:56] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; some are however very active\n[12:56] &lt;kanashiro&gt; sharing those things would be great for the new people like me :)\n[12:56] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; *are very\n[12:56] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Can we have a survey a general one covering the issues and pain points if any for a start?\n[12:56] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; that's a good idea\n[12:57] &lt;kanashiro&gt; that'd be a good start IMO\n[12:57] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; +1\n[12:57] &lt;youngbin&gt; yup soduns like good idea :)\n[12:57] &lt;youngbin&gt; +1\n[12:57] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1\n[12:57] &lt;kanashiro&gt; +1\n[12:57] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok we shall prepare one\n[12:57] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes\n[12:58] &lt;mapreri&gt; that's likely point 5 of this meeting? kindaâ¦\n[12:58] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; each of us come up with questions, and we can make a final version next month\n[12:58] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Seems good\n[12:58] &lt;youngbin&gt; sounds good. do we want to organize some action items before moving on?\n[12:58] &lt;mapreri&gt; but of course, I agree.\n[12:58] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; well lets just reorganize and go back to the topics\n[12:59] &lt;mapreri&gt; please.\n[12:59] &lt;youngbin&gt; ok\n[12:59] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; cool DiogoConstantino..\n[12:59] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; continuing on communication\n[12:59] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; how do we promote/communicate the idea of LoCos?\n[12:59] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and where?\n[12:59] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; this is also part of our mission\n[13:00] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; can we maybe do an Ubuntu On Air session?\n[13:00] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Social media and in opensource conferences and on YouTube?\n[13:01] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 for ubuntu on air\n[13:01] &lt;youngbin&gt; we can think about what loco do first. what loco usually do would be gathering folks interested in ubuntu and foss in their region\n[13:01] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; that's a good idea, there's a lot we alreay know\n[13:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; but maybe we don't know a lot\n[13:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I do know a bit about Europe\n[13:02] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Exactly\n[13:02] &lt;kanashiro&gt; at least for me (who is new to this subject in Ubuntu) it is hard to say when I do not understand well who we are trying to reach out exactly. That's why I mentioned that understanding the current state would help in any further action\n[13:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; also what Lina reported from Colombia\n[13:02] &lt;kanashiro&gt; but I understand you guys have more knowledge than me on this\n[13:02] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 to kanashiro here\n[13:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; it seems that we are not ready to talk about promotion at all to me\n[13:03] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok\n[13:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; first step is listing out what we have (locos , then work from there.\n[13:03] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Lets develop from grassroots level first\n[13:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; first step is listing out what we have (locos + what they are doing right now), then work from there.\n[13:03] &lt;kanashiro&gt; +1\n[13:03] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok\n[13:03] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; +1\n[13:03] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1\n[13:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; about that\n[13:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; do tell\n[13:04] &lt;mapreri&gt; we have a loco-council@lists.ubuntu.com private mail list, which I believe nobody subscribed us to.  I'm sure we will eventually need that private thing.  Should I liaise with IS to take it over?\n[13:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; yes please\n[13:05] &lt;mapreri&gt; (i have a previous experience on taking over MLsâ¦)\n[13:05] &lt;youngbin&gt; Oops my network on laptop got disconnected:(\n[13:05] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; I am on that list from over 10 years\n[13:05] &lt;mapreri&gt; coolbhavi: do you have the admin pw?\n[13:05] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Because of my last term\n[13:05] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; me, in my loco. im doing some fbpage. sad to say. only few followers i have in ubuntu page in social media.\n[13:05] &lt;youngbin&gt; Agreed with mapreri said before mentioned before mailing list\n[13:05] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so we all agree\n[13:05] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; nice\n[13:06] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; mapreri: I am afraid I lost it as it got inactive 7 years ago\n[13:06] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; let's just do the vote on the bot thing\n[13:06] &lt;mIk3_08&gt; i agree with mapreri too.\n[13:06] &lt;youngbin&gt; And yes, I also agree with mailing list for some private thing\n[13:06] &lt;kanashiro&gt; sorry guys, but I will need to leave in around 5 minutes.

lets move on to the next topic\n[13:21] &lt;mapreri&gt; the text after #vote is the "title" of what we are voting on\n[13:21] &lt;mapreri&gt; (and such text gets carried over to the minutes)\n[13:21] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ah ok\n[13:21] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic Increasing visibility of the rebirth of the LoCo Council\n[13:22] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so do we need to do something about this, and how?\n[13:22] &lt;mapreri&gt; (so no "#vote +1" does not cast a vote; the "+1" needs to be the first chars of the line)\n[13:22] &lt;youngbin&gt; DiogoConstantino: so it's about promoting that we're back?\n[13:23] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; yes\n[13:23] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; For this we can do a team meeting and stream on Ubuntu on air maybe?\n[13:23] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Including the usual discourse social media and uwn\n[13:24] &lt;mapreri&gt; I think we could do such thing, pulling in LoCo leaders, etc, after having a list of such locosâ¦\n[13:24] &lt;youngbin&gt; AMA on UbuntuOnAir? discourse, social, blog, uwn also good way to promote\n[13:24] &lt;mapreri&gt; an AMA could be good.  with the loco leaders :P\n[13:24] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes\n[13:24] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we can also use it to announce the survey\n[13:24] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes\n[13:25] &lt;youngbin&gt; yups agreed that we should reach out loco leaders first. im actually trying to reach out VN loco (since fossasia happening in Hanoi early April)\n[13:25] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so the idea is to do an AMA on Ubuntu On Air, and announce the survey?\n[13:26] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes\n[13:26] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok lets vote on it\n[13:26] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #vote to do an AMA on Ubuntu On Air, and announce the survey?\n[13:26] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: to do an AMA on Ubuntu On Air, and announce the survey?\n[13:26] &lt;meetingology&gt;

Votes for: 4, Votes against: 0, Abstentions: 0\n[13:29] &lt;meetingology&gt; Motion carried\n[13:29] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; next topic?\n[13:29] &lt;youngbin&gt; yups\n[13:29] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic Identification of existing LoCoâs and prospective LoCoâs\n[13:30] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so this is pretty much what we also want to do with the survey, but the propective LoCo's is also in here\n[13:30] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we also want to know what people need to take the next step\n[13:31] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and become an official LoCo\n[13:31] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I feel it's slightly different\n[13:31] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; the issues might be different\n[13:31] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; and the help we can spare might also be different\n[13:31] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Survey and manual reachout will help here I guess.. as far as I remember there was a tool called locolint which checked the basics of active or inactive last time I was around\n[13:32] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we should split this into two paths/groups of questions on the survey\n[13:32] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; coolbhavi: I never heard of that before\n[13:33] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; should be this? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil/LoCoLint\n[13:33] &lt;youngbin&gt; https://launchpad.net/locolint i think so...?\n[13:34] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we can try to check it\n[13:34] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes\n[13:34] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; https://launchpad.net/locolint\n[13:34] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; but this is more for the (re)validation I believe\n[13:35] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; or ?\n[13:35] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes but more features can be added\n[13:36] &lt;mapreri&gt; I really don't think we need to be so analytical about the current LoCo tbh.\n[13:36] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so anyway we can use the Ubuntu On Air to appeal LoCo Leaders to contact us and prospective Loco teams as well\n[13:36] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; at FOSDEM, we tried to promote LoCo's so I expect something to come from that\n[13:37] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 maperi as we are just restarting :)\n[13:37] &lt;youngbin&gt; agreed with mapreri. and what DiogoConstantino done at fosdem sounds good :)\n[13:38] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Same here\n[13:38] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so no specific action point besides the appeal on the stream, right?\n[13:38] &lt;youngbin&gt; me and coolbhavi plan to have booth on fossasia too we can also do LoCo promo there\n[13:38] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; nice\n[13:38] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes\n[13:39] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok lets move on to the next topic\n[13:39] &lt;mapreri&gt; i kind of envision just mailing all locos and ask you "do you exist?  what's your name?  what are you doing lately?"\n[13:39] &lt;mapreri&gt; and from there invite them for a chat in that call maybe.\n[13:39] &lt;youngbin&gt; mapreri: yup that would be also something we can try\n[13:40] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I don't think it would be a good fit for a stream, but a private call yes\n[13:40] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; with the LoCo Leaders\n[13:40] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 kind of reminds me of the developer advisory team in 2013\n[13:40] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; kind of an office hour for the LoCo Leaders\n[13:41] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Exactly\n[13:41] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I like it because it will be complementary to the survey, we can include ont he survey a question regarding the usefullness and schedule for such thing\n[13:42] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; anything else?\n[13:42] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; That's what the developer advisory team was doing with the developers in the community back in 2012 reach out, survey, office hour and summary\n[13:43] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; as it appears there's nothing else on the topic\n[13:43] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; lets move on to the next\n[13:43] &lt;youngbin&gt; yups we can move on\n[13:43] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic Identification of additional LoCo support structures\n[13:43] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so what I mean about this\n[13:44] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; is something like the Ubuntu Europe Federation\n[13:44] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; which is an association of European Ubuntu LoCo's\n[13:44] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; that tries to help Ubuntu LoCo's in similar ways to the LoCo Council, but also, by being a legal represation to sign contracts and such\n[13:45] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1\n[13:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; some of the LoCo's are already associations\n[13:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; most are not\n[13:45] &lt;youngbin&gt; so kind of fiscal host and legal partner for locos?\n[13:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; yes\n[13:45] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; this is what the Ubuntu Europe Federation does\n[13:45] &lt;youngbin&gt; would need some more discussion. but agree that it would be useful :)\n[13:46] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; it's facilitated by the legal interoperabilidaty in Europe\n[13:46] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Need one for India too looking at the challenges of Ubucon Asia\n[13:46] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; coolbhavi: is the Free Software Foundation India not a thing?\n[13:46] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; maybe they would be willing\n[13:47] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; https://fsf.org.in/\n[13:47] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes but they have their own challenges\n[13:47] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Even SFI\n[13:47] &lt;youngbin&gt; I remember India LoCo actually using FOSSUnited for UbuCon Asia but seems like it has some limitation due to regulation.\n[13:47] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes\n[13:48] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so there's nothing like Ubuntu Europe elsewhere...\n[13:49] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; None that I am aware of\n[13:49] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I can see how the EU makes it easier\n[13:49] &lt;mapreri&gt; indeed\n[13:49] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; well let's keep this in mind, and if ideas on how to overcome this come, take note and mention them on the meetings\n[13:49] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes being a permanent resident in the EU I can see a lot of advantages\n[13:49] &lt;mapreri&gt; remember that many countries have plenty of capital controls in place that makes moving money in/out of them annoying, so something similar to Ubuntu EU is hard to recreate cross-countries in other areas of the world.\n[13:50] &lt;youngbin&gt; I agree with the idea basically. but some loco might have some limitation with access due to local regulation.\n[13:50] &lt;youngbin&gt; agreed with mapreri\n[13:50] &lt;youngbin&gt; maybe we can do some research first?\n[13:50] &lt;mapreri&gt; or not recognizing particular entities from other countries (when talking about signing stuff, etc)\n[13:50] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; youngbin: we should\n[13:50] &lt;mapreri&gt; but for EU, that's great and useful once it running full steam indeed!\n[13:51] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; +1 there is a ton of difference I can see and we should do some research\n[13:51] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; in the EU it exits, but it's not operational in practice\n[13:51] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; From the eu to India I have experience\n[13:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok lets research and come back to it when we have something\n[13:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; next topic:\n[13:52] &lt;youngbin&gt; sounds good\n[13:52] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; I am interested\n[13:52] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic LoCo outreach\n[13:53] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we have already talked about it a bit, but is there something you want to add?\n[13:53] &lt;youngbin&gt; well i added this topic but seems like we have already discussed on previous topics\n[13:53] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Lets start with survey for the outreach and take it step by step\n[13:53] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok\n[13:54] &lt;mapreri&gt; yep\n[13:54] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so now it's time for coolbhavi to report on the Indian Loco?\n[13:54] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Yes.. we are hosting ubucon Asia this year in Jaipur India\n[13:54] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; #topic coolbhavi to report on the Indian Loco\n[13:55] &lt;youngbin&gt; so seems like it's part of AOB :)\n[13:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; how's that comming along?\n[13:55] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; And the team is working on negotiating the venue now\n[13:55] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; is there something we can do to help?\n[13:55] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; This years ubucon Asia is on aug 31 to September 2\n[13:56] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; now, or something you predict for the next few months?\n[13:56] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Will reach out incase help is required in the coming months\n[13:57] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok\n[13:57] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Right now we are working on logistics and it has its own challenges in the regulations in India\n[13:57] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; is there something that surprised you?\n[13:58] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; maybe it will surprise any other Ubucon organizer elsewhere\n[13:58] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Actually we planned for a joint event with gnome asia and that is also under discussion\n[13:58] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; nice\n[13:59] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; No surprises till now as we expected challenges due to regulations\n[13:59] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; And we are working around it\n[13:59] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I and a few people from Debian are planning to try DebConf 26 in Portugal, and if we can we also try Ubucon Europe here the days before\n[14:00] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Only surprise is the venue asking for 50 percent of ticket sales as venue fees\n[14:00] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; So we are negotiating\n[14:00] &lt;youngbin&gt; coolbhavi: many thanks for the work :) looking forward to see UbuCon Asia happening in Jaipur\n[14:00] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; yes\n[14:01] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; keep it up\n[14:01] &lt;youngbin&gt; coolbhavi: So the fee rate is depending on ticket pricing?\n[14:01] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Welcome and yes we are excited too\n[14:01] &lt;youngbin&gt; i think i will be also busy with organizing events: UbuCon Asia, UbuCon KR, DebConf24 so many lol\n[14:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; yes\n[14:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; those are a lot\n[14:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I have less\n[14:02] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; youngbin: they are not bothered about the fee rate they need 50 percent of whatever ticket sales\n[14:02] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; UbunCon Portugal which will be during the Free Software Festival, and I'm part of the orga for both\n[14:02] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Which I have a meeting on Monday\n[14:02] &lt;youngbin&gt; :+1\n[14:03] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; As exams are still going on in parts of the country\n[14:03] &lt;mapreri&gt; coolbhavi: ticket 0$, just ask for donations :P\n[14:03] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ;P\n[14:03] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; That's my worst case scenario\n[14:04] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Haha\n[14:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; we only charged for the first Ubucon Europe\n[14:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; but we got meals for free\n[14:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; in return\n[14:04] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; all others where gratis\n[14:05] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Hmm good point will negotiate and come up with more details next meeting\n[14:05] &lt;mapreri&gt; personally I'll need to go in ~15 mins, FYI\n[14:05] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; I also\n[14:05] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; so lets end here\n[14:05] &lt;youngbin&gt; same\n[14:05] &lt;coolbhavi&gt; Same here\n[14:05] &lt;youngbin&gt;

March 8th looks good to me yep\n[14:06] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; ok I'll check with Kanashiro\n[14:06] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt; if it's ok with him we can announce it\n[14:07] &lt;DiogoConstantino&gt;

#link https://warthogs.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SEC/boards/594\n[15:46] &lt;eslerm&gt; for apparmor profiles, we oculd put this off until after 24.04\n[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; this has been discussed in the past\n[15:46] &lt;eslerm&gt; an apparmor profile will be required for authd\n[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it was a "would be nice, but sometimes is impossibly hard" case\n[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; just like some others we had\n[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'm +1 on having such a rule\n[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; after all we keep having "add profiles" items every cycle\n[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; to get things added in the past isolated\n[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but\n[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I'd ask for some "not too easy, but there is a way out" kind of wording\n[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; if you happen to be providing the 1245676th package of the gnome stack\n[15:48] &lt;eslerm&gt; recently, the apparmor team has begun needing to write profiles (there is a new mandate) and it would be nice if owning or development teams owned that\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; then you can't be expected to be the one that makes all gnome isolated\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; for example\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I've seen the updates on jira about adding apparmor\n[15:48] &lt;eslerm&gt; that type of wording works\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and I smiled as - like I said - we do that almost every cycle for a while\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but we had cases where you just can not predict the millions of ways something is used\n[15:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; so very true\n[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; I believe apparmor folks would be responsible to review, it would be reasonable\n[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; with a wording that is not too allowing but leaving a door open I'm ok\n[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; will you or the apparmor folks provide a PR on how they think\n[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; can do\n[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we can then discuss until we reach a wording we believe that works\n[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and the first few passing that will then tell us how possible or impossible that is\n[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; I wanted to start the discussion, and work on this mostly for 24.10\n[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so epxect reviewing this in a while\n[15:50] &lt;eslerm&gt; thank you\n[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ack on please not being applicable to 24.04 super late\n[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

CPC has a packageset (ubuntu-cloud; cf: https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/packagesets/noble/ubuntu-cloud). We'd like to revive it and the first step would be to polish it a bit. Would it be okay to drop some packages from the package and add some new via the usual process (mail devel-permissions@ with the updated list and collect\n[16:05] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; +1s, et al). Would anyone have an objection?\n[16:05] &lt;sil2100&gt; I don't see why not, we can vote on the actual packageset changes via ML as usual\n[16:05] &lt;bdmurray&gt; I don't think it is necessary to review removals.\n[16:05] &lt;rbasak&gt; As long as the changes match the defined packageset description "Packages required to create, bootstrap, use or configure Ubuntu Cloud images and their derivatives" then we only require one DMB member to approve.\n[16:05] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Only additions.\n[16:05] &lt;rbasak&gt; Though please keep the record on the ML\n[16:06] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; of course\n[16:07] &lt;bdmurray&gt; o/ one topic\n[16:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; perfect, since there are no objections, I'll come back with the new set in some time on the list.\n[16:07] &lt;utkarsh2102&gt; yes, please\n[16:07] &lt;bdmurray&gt; me?\n[16:08] &lt;bdmurray&gt; We need to run an election in the next couple of months.

The wiki page for the Review Boards is available here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards\n[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; We will attempt to get through all the applicants that have added themselves to that list, or posted a thread to the Ubuntu Discourse, before today's meeting. If we are unable to make it through the complete list due to time constraints, then at the next meeting we will pick up where we left off.\n[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; The format for the meeting is as follows: We will go through the list of applicants one by one, by date of application (FIFO).\n[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; Each applicant should introduce themselves (1-5 sentences) and provide links to their Ubuntu Wiki page or Ubuntu Discourse thread. After the introduction, the members of the Membership Review Board will review the pages and, if needed, ask the applicant further questions.\n[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; During this time, it is encouraged for other members of the community to show their support for the applicant. Do not be alarmed if the members of the Membership Review Board are quiet during this time; they are reading wiki/launchpad/forum/other pages and deciding how they are going to vote.\n[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; When the board is ready to vote, they will publicly vote in the channel with either +1, 0, or -1 (for membership, abstain, and against membership, respectively). If most of the voting board members vote +1, then the applicant is now an official Ubuntu member! (Feel free congratulate them!)\n[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; Now, with any further ado, let's get started with the first applicant...\n[20:03] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; We only have one applicant today, Jason Nucciaarone\n[20:04] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Hello everyone o/\n[20:04] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; @nuccitheboss can you please introduce yourself to the board and share your launchpad and application links\n[20:04] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Yes yes\n[20:04] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; I'll share the links first and then write my bio\n[20:05] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Application link: https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jason-c-nucciarone-membership-application/41501/1\n[20:05] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/~nuccitheboss\n[20:05] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; GitHub: https://github.com/NucciTheBoss\n[20:06] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; HPC community team: https://ubuntu.com/community/governance/teams/hpc\n[20:06] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Okay - time for intro\n[20:10] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; My name is Jason C. Nucciarone and I am an HPC engineer at Canonical, and a "Not so Ancient Elder" of the Ubuntu HPC community. Outside my primary duties at Canonical, I like to work with all things community. I started the HPC community team with several folks in the Ubuntu community to work on "Charmed HPC," which is a supercomputing stack that we are developing for Ubuntu. I am dedicated to this project because I want\n[20:10] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; to see Ubuntu more represented in the HPC ecosystem and be a viable alternative to the RHELatives. I do all sorts of things HPC, such as working with Simon, Aaron, and Mauro to organise Ubuntu-related conference, and I submit to lots of conference to speak about using Ubuntu for supercomputing\n[20:11] &lt;Kilos&gt; ty\n[20:12] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; ok. I'll let the board peruse those links and post and questions with the first question, which is mandatory:\n[20:12] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; You have signed the Code of Conduct. Do you affirm that you have read and understood the whole document, and do you agree to be bound by the terms for the duration of your membership should it be granted?\n[20:12] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; Yes!\n[20:12] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; awesome. thank you for confirming. I'll open the floor to the rest of the board to ask any questions\n[20:14] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; None as testimonials speak well :D\n[20:14] &lt;Kilos&gt; ditto\n[20:15] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; ok. then lets move on to the voting cos I'm happy as well\n[20:16] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; #vote Jason Nucciarone's membership application\n[20:16] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Jason Nucciarone's membership application\n[20:16] &lt;meetingology&gt; Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')\n[20:16] &lt;Kilos&gt; +1\n[20:16] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 received from Kilos\n[20:16] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; #voters lucyllewy Kilos Bashing-om\n[20:16] &lt;meetingology&gt; Current voters: Bashing-om, Kilos, lucyllewy\n[20:17] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; +1 All good; significant contributions with accreditied testimonials of contributions.\n[20:17] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 All good; significant contributions with accreditied testimonials of contributions. received from Bashing-om\n[20:18] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; +1 Very thorough application and well prepared with lots of great testimonials. you'd make an excellent member.\n[20:18] &lt;meetingology&gt; +1 Very thorough application and well prepared with lots of great testimonials. you'd make an excellent member. received from lucyllewy\n[20:18] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; Wildman votes +1 via proxy\n[20:19] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; Mattia Rizzolo Votes +1 via proxy\n[20:19] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; #endvote\n[20:19] &lt;meetingology&gt; Voting ended on: Jason Nucciarone's membership application\n[20:19] &lt;meetingology&gt; Votes for: 3, Votes against: 0, Abstentions: 0\n[20:19] &lt;meetingology&gt; Motion carried\n[20:19] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; CONGRATULATIONS!\n[20:19] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; &lt;3\n[20:19] &lt;aaronprisk&gt; Congrats, Nucci!! :)\n[20:19] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; ð¥³\n[20:19] &lt;ilvipero&gt; wohooo\n[20:19] &lt;Kilos&gt; Well done nuccitheboss Keep up the good work\n[20:20] &lt;nuccitheboss&gt; I have goosebumps now I'm so happy lol\n[20:20] &lt;Kilos&gt; You earned it\n[20:20] &lt;ilvipero&gt; I am really happy to see Nucci as an Ubuntu Member! he is one of the most orange humans on this planet\n[20:20] &lt;Bashing-om&gt; nuccitheboss:\o/ well done !\n[20:20] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; Congratulations on your membership, nuccitheboss\n[20:21] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; with that and no more applicants I'll wrap up.\n[20:21] &lt;lucyllewy&gt; Congratulations to all the new members.

(I've had one or two OOB uploads approved by AAs in edge cases though as a coredev)\n[17:10] &lt;teward&gt; but ye it's outside the standard scope\n[17:11]  * schopin actually looks at the proposed changes\n[17:12] &lt;teward&gt; see this is the thing that makes me pause here\n[17:12] &lt;teward&gt; "`google-guest-agent` is a package provided by Google for installation within guests that run on Google Compute Engine (GCE)"\n[17:13] &lt;teward&gt; GCE shouldn't be offering those older images still\n[17:13] &lt;teward&gt; if they are they're doing something odd/stupid\n[17:13] &lt;teward&gt; or rather, they shouldn't offer those images for *NEW* installs IMO\n[17:14] &lt;teward&gt; if they simply... disable Xenial / Bionic image selection... that kind of solves the issue already no?\n[17:15] &lt;schopin&gt; I'm not much of a cloud person, are dist-upgrades not a thing in that domain?\n[17:16] &lt;teward&gt; last i checked GCE behaved like AWS EC2 instances or VPSes, and can dist-upgrade.  I'm not *google* but if this package is provided **for installation within guests** and does something that enables GCE stuff in the VM environment (similar to open-vm-tools for VMware for example), then it would be part of the image on-install\n[17:17] &lt;teward&gt; and if the older images are *gone* then the issue is irrelevant since new installs can't be run for those releases\n[17:17] &lt;teward&gt; and anything having the image already would already have everything\n[17:17] &lt;teward&gt; my 2 cents and cursory untested unvetted thoughts\n[17:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not familiar with their offering but I am aware that you can get instances from cloud vendors that have Ubuntu Pro included, and therefore I infer that it makes sense for cloud vendors to continue offering those instance types until EOL.\n[17:17] &lt;teward&gt; rbasak: by EOL do you mean Pro EOL or overall EOL/\n[17:18] &lt;teward&gt; and in which case if Pro is enabled shouldn't this be distributed via ESM / Pro and not standard SRU\n[17:18] &lt;rbasak&gt; End of Standard Support = 5 years; End of Life = 10 years or whatever Pro ends up being by then.\n[17:18] &lt;schopin&gt; Well yes, that's why I directed them to Security (because in my mind Pro updates -&gt; Security)\n[17:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not sure if the agent needs to be special via SRU. We do push the Pro Client via SRU as an exception (details and rationale documented at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuAdvantageToolsUpdates)\n[17:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; Looking at the bug, sounds like the plan is to put it in via ESM, and it's just a matter of managing the bug tasks appropriately?\n=== arif-ali_ is now known as arif-ali\n=== arraybolt3_wc is now known as arraybolt3\n\n# UBUNTU-MEETING\n\n=== mIk3_09 is now known as mIk3_08\n=== arraybolt3_wc is now known as arraybolt3\n\n</content></entry><entry><id>30.01.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</id><title>30.01.2024: ubuntu-security, ubuntu-meeting</title><updated>2024-06-09T19:08:07.674222+00:00</updated><content># UBUNTU-SECURITY\n\n=== JanC is now known as Guest5945\n=== JanC_ is now known as JanC\n=== cpaelzer_ is now known as cpaelzer\n=== arraybolt3 is now known as arraybolt3_wc\n=== shettysudhird is now known as sshetty\n=== arraybolt3_wc is now known as arraybolt3\n=== shettysudhird is now known as sshetty\n\n# UBUNTU-MEETING\n\n=== JanC_ is now known as JanC\n[15:20] &lt;didrocks&gt; hey MIR team, as usual, not available but will read the backlog later.

anyone else before I go into details?\n[15:43] &lt;sarnold&gt; I don't think so...\n[15:43] &lt;slyon&gt; no\n[15:43] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, then here the FYI\n[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; there is effort in making the default set of tools available for performance and crash analysis nicer to the users\n[15:44] &lt;sarnold&gt; nice\n[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; details vary and depend on the context, no need to go into too much details - if you are curious get in touch\n[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but what is worth\n[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; is that out of that effort there will be an expected flurry of MIRs and associated security reviews coming\n[15:44] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; the amount is probably 3-8\n[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so not too insane\n[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; but it will be noble time-frame\n[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so to whatever amount you can, reserve some time and tell your managers upfront\n[15:45] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; involved are mostly kernel, foundations and server - but to some extend anyone that feels to belong to *ubuntu*\n[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; so much for now I'd think\n[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; I think the MIR review capactity is fine for this\n[15:46] &lt;eslerm&gt; knowning which packages to plan for would help\n[15:46] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; for security we thought this is worth to be mentioned to know about it by now instead of out of a sudden\n[15:46] &lt;eslerm&gt; it is appreciated :)\n[15:47] &lt;sarnold&gt; in yesterday's team meeting I communicated that there's usually a flurry of last-minute packages to review\n[15:47] &lt;sarnold&gt; so hopefully our need for more reviewers won't come as a surprise\n[15:47] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: sarnold: For details you can go to FO147 spec for now and anything you find linked from jira Fr-6202\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; with that being said, I think we are good for now\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; any other famous last words?\n[15:48] &lt;sarnold&gt; have a nice day?\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, that is a now\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; no\n[15:48] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; see you all\n[15:48] &lt;sarnold&gt;

Minutes at https://ubottu.com/meetingology/logs/ubuntu-meeting/2024/ubuntu-meeting.2024-01-30-15.33.moin.txt\n[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; thanks all o/\n=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk\n=== pushkarnk1 is now known as pushkarnk\n=== arraybolt3 is now known as arraybolt3_wc\n[19:57] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; o/\n[20:00] &lt;rbasak&gt; o/\n[20:00]  * vorlon waves\n[20:00] &lt;vorlon&gt; I believe I'm chairing today\n[20:00] &lt;amurray&gt; o/\n[20:01] &lt;sil2100&gt; Apologies everyone, I won't be able to actively participate in today's meeting. I'm fighting quite a headache and I'm afraid I'll be useless today\n[20:01] &lt;vorlon&gt; sil2100: rest well\n[20:01] &lt;seb128&gt; hey\n[20:01] &lt;vorlon&gt; #startmeeting\n[20:01] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting started at 20:01:50 UTC.  The chair is vorlon.  Information about MeetBot at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology\n[20:01] &lt;meetingology&gt; Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick\n[20:01] &lt;vorlon&gt; [topic] Apologies\n[20:02] &lt;vorlon&gt; sil2100 in real time let us know he won't be attending today\n[20:02] &lt;rbasak&gt; The agenda looks quiet today, but I think there are some flavour LTS qualifications outstanding from the ML, and also I'd like to discuss my "onsensus on question of test plans for third party apps" action item if we have time.\n[20:02] &lt;vorlon&gt; and it looks like we have everyone else here?\n[20:03] &lt;vorlon&gt; #topic Action review\n[20:03] &lt;vorlon&gt; there are a lot of actions listed; rather than going point-by-point, can I just ask if anyone has updates, and assume the rest are carry-over? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoardAgenda\n[20:04] &lt;rbasak&gt; All mine are to carry over please. Though as above I've been looking at one, might as well carry it over until discussed since it's unlikely to be resolved completely today.\n[20:04] &lt;amurray&gt; sounds good to me (mine are all carry-over)\n[20:04] &lt;seb128&gt; ACTION: seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu cinnamon on 24.04 request  -&gt; https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002853.html\n[20:04] &lt;seb128&gt; no reply from them though\n[20:04] &lt;seb128&gt; ACTION: seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu budgie on 24.04 request  -&gt; https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002855.html\n[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: thanks\n[20:05] &lt;seb128&gt; and we had 4 +1 votes so I think that's approved\n[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; agreed\n[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; mine is also carry-over\n[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: do you want to send a follow-up email to confirm this is approved?\n[20:05] &lt;vorlon&gt; (amurray had an action to do so for UbuntuKylin)\n[20:06] &lt;amurray&gt; yeah not sure how I missed that but will get to it later today\n[20:06] &lt;seb128&gt; vorlon, yes, I will send the budgie email\n[20:07] &lt;vorlon&gt; #action seb128 to send confirmation of successful LTS status for UbuntuBudgie 24.04\n[20:07] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: seb128 to send confirmation of successful LTS status for UbuntuBudgie 24.04\n[20:07] &lt;vorlon&gt; #topic Scan the mailing list archive for anything we missed (standing item)\n[20:07] &lt;vorlon&gt; the various vote threads are accounted for, I think\n[20:07] &lt;vorlon&gt; two other threads on there we should probably touch base on\n[20:08] &lt;vorlon&gt; first is "VirtualBox Postmortem"\n[20:08] &lt;vorlon&gt; tsimonq2 let me know he wasn't available to attend this meeting today\n[20:08] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I'm here in his absence.\n[20:08] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (I did a bunch of the VirtualBox testing to solve the bug that email is related to.)\n[20:09] &lt;vorlon&gt; I have lots of thoughts in regards to that email, but perhaps someone who's not wearing dual TB + SRU hats wants to comment first\n[20:09] &lt;vorlon&gt; (which would be seb128 or amurray rather than rbasak or myself)\n[20:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; I do wear both hats, but my usual response in these cases is to ask for the responsible team to respond in the first instance.\n[20:10] &lt;rbasak&gt; In other words, even when TB escalation is appropriate, the TB should seek to get input from both sides - from both the complainant(s) and the responsible teams. In this case that'd be the SRU team, rather than non-SRU team members.\n[20:11] &lt;seb128&gt; right, I'm unsure if that's a topic for the TB at this point, I would like at least to see a reply from the SRU team first\n[20:11] &lt;vorlon&gt; well I'm going to say that the reason I haven't responded to this email at all yet is that I found it to be an entirely unconstructive and anti-collaborative approach to the question\n[20:11] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, vorlon, do you have any insight if the SRU team is working on a reply?\n[20:11] &lt;amurray&gt; from my point of view, whilst I can entirely understand the frustrations expressed in the email, I also can sympathise with the SRU team et al - due to the distributed / silo'd nature of Ubuntu development this kind of thing feels sometimes inevitable even when we try hard to coordinate to avoid such situations\n[20:12] &lt;amurray&gt; so unless a response from the SRU team highlights any particular problems on their side, I am not sure there is much for the TB to do at this time\n[20:12] &lt;vorlon&gt; I'm not aware of a current SRU team decision about responding to the email\n[20:12] &lt;rbasak&gt; The SRU team haven't had an opportunity to discuss this yet really.\n[20:13] &lt;rbasak&gt; The relevant people to discuss this are in a late-ish timezone, and we usually chat every four weeks, and that hasn't come up yet.\n[20:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; I don't mind going into more details now, on behalf of the SRU team, and while vorlon's also here. But maybe that's not really appropriate right now (or do others think otherwise?)\n[20:14] &lt;seb128&gt; is that going to happen before the next TB meeting then? if so maybe let's revisit next time?\n[20:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; It might be if we were in a rush, but I have noticed SRU activity on this package, so is there still a rush?\n[20:14] &lt;vorlon&gt; should happen this week I think?\n[20:14] &lt;rbasak&gt; Yes - on Thursday - assuming the other relevant people are able to attend.\n[20:14] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; February 2, the new VBox SRU should be ready to go out. Me and LoB already did all verificaiton.\n[20:15] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; So I can confirm this week.\n[20:15] &lt;vorlon&gt; yes, SRU team meeting Thursday\n[20:15] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (assuming the SRU team does migrations from -proposed to -updates on Friday - I don't actually know if this is the case)\n[20:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'd like to be constructive here, but I'm finding that quite challenging.\n[20:15] &lt;rbasak&gt; A couple of things to note, if you're expecting the release to happen because you've marked verification-done...\n[20:16] &lt;seb128&gt; that's a long email with a lot of details, but to me it seems the SRU team should maybe add to their process to check if a kernel update breaks virtualbox\n[20:17] &lt;vorlon&gt; yes, a "post mortem" which assumes itself to be in possession of all of the facts without consulting &gt; half the people involved, and drawing conclusions and assigning blame, is not a springboard for a constructive discussion\n[20:17] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: that's the thing, I haven't had time to dig into this, but kernel SRUs are supposed to check the results of all dkms package builds\n[20:17] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I think with the virtualbox breakage bug, the issue was that the update was never accepted into proposed in the first place. There was nothing any other team could have done.\n[20:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#virtualbox is false. Contrary to what that says, I don't consider anything pre-approved by the SRU. I've mentioned this on IRC to LocutusOfBorg before.\n[20:17] &lt;rbasak&gt; by the SRU team\n[20:18] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I didn't read Simon's email as attempting to be a be-all-end-all postmortem, I thought it was intended to start discussion, laying out everything Simon knew already. His tone is rather negative, but I think he was trying to be constructive and that he had some good points if you read past the tone.\n[20:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; From what I consider to be the draft at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VirtualboxUpdates, it's not clear to me what precisely is committed to being verified, and even if it were, that hasn't been agreed by the SRU team. Therefore, there isn't a standard for me to confirm against that appopriate verification has been performed.\n[20:19] &lt;vorlon&gt; arraybolt3: telling the SRU team "you owe N an apology" is a pretty hard tone to get past.\n[20:19] &lt;rbasak&gt; In bug 2050891, currently the Test Plan says: "Install virtualbox, run VMs". That is not an acceptable test plan IMHO.\n[20:19] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Valid, I just am saying, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.\n[20:19] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2050891 in virtualbox-hwe (Ubuntu Mantic) "[SRU] virtualbox 6.1.50 and 7.0.14" [Undecided, Fix Committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2050891\n[20:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; I believe this has all been raised before, and not addressed.\n[20:20] &lt;rbasak&gt; So from my perspective, were I asked to release it, the SRU is blocked.\n[20:20] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; rbasak: I think LocutusOfBorg simply put the test plan in the wrong spot.\n[20:20] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; To be fair, LoB told people in private chats that he was feeling ignored and got tired of pinging in #ubuntu-release since October that an SRU of virtualbox was ready for review. So, this was not a failure on his part.\n[20:20] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; It's right under "Where Problems Could Occur" under the "Some Guest OSes might fail to load" part.\n[20:21] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; Literally broke his spirit. That's no way to treat a community member.\n[20:21] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I can fix that right now if it's needed to unblock the SRU.\n[20:21] &lt;rbasak&gt; My frustration is that we iterated enough times already and it's still not acceptable to me. When I've been asked, I've tried to be helpful. I believe that conversation has already been linked to.\n[20:22] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let's be constructive please.\n[20:23] &lt;seb128&gt; I didn't found the detail by reading through the email again, but did anyone attempted to block promotion to updates of the kernel by flagging that it created a regression?\n[20:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; I hope it's quite clear that currently expectations are far from being met, and that this is the root cause of the issue.\n[20:23] &lt;seb128&gt; if not why did people do IRC pings instead of following the process?\n[20:23] &lt;rbasak&gt; So let's try to figure out how to get to a place where they are met, rather than throw accusations around.\n[20:23] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; seb128: tsimonq2 pinged xnox .\n[20:23] &lt;seb128&gt; xnox isn't an SRU team member\n[20:24] &lt;seb128&gt; and that wouldn't flag the SRU as not to promote on the SRU report\n[20:24] &lt;seb128&gt; anyway, I don't think we will resolve that tonight\n[20:24] &lt;seb128&gt; I would suggest we wait for the SRU team meeting this week and to see if there is an outcome of that discussion\n[20:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; true, but I think it's useful to have this frank discussion about some of the issues here, that as I mentioned was a bit blocked on the lists because long-form emails are something of a barrier\n[20:25] &lt;rbasak&gt; From my perspective, if someone says something is ready for review, I ask for substantial changes, they don't fix what I requested and then say it's ready for review again, so I ask for substantial changes, ad infinitum, at what point is it no longer reasonable to claim that I'm treating the uploader badly?\n[20:25] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; Another point: The SRU team meets *every four weeks?* Is this a time constraint issue, because, as someone with a leadership degree, this is not how teams are run under any circumstance. Furthermore, does the SRU team meet *behind closed doors*? That seems pretty suspicious to me.\n[20:26] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I'm fairly certain there's an SRU team meeting in this channel every four weeks?\n[20:26] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; rbasak: "I believe that conversation has already been linked to." I may be blind, but I don't see the link. (I'd just like to look over it so I can get a better understanding.)\n[20:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; I reject the characterization of this as "suspicious".  The SRU team is not a "leadership" team, it is a functional team with work to do and the meetings are internal to the team for getting things done\n[20:27] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; vorlon: A community team though, with community governance? I reject the notion that an open source team should be behind closed doors.\n[20:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; expecting teams to not have private meetings for working through outstanding task lists is unhelpful\n[20:28] &lt;vorlon&gt; I categorically reject this framing\n[20:28] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; I categorically disagree.\n[20:28] &lt;rbasak&gt; arraybolt3: it's in tsimonq2's email\n[20:28] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I'll have to agree with vorlon. We have a private Matrix Operators meeting every week in order to discuss difficult technical and management topics, we're an open-source and community-related team, and this is what is working best for us so far.\n[20:28] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; rbasak: thanks, I am blind then :P\n[20:29] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; arraybolt3: However, an SRU team isn't a team that has to deal with private matters regarding individuals.\n[20:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; arraybolt3: well, it is difficult. That's the issue with these threads that get longer and longer - they take expontentially more time to follow.\n[20:29] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; our meetings aren't about those either yet.\n[20:30] &lt;seb128&gt; rbasak, what I don't understand is that from that number of pings and the review of the virtualbox SRU how did we end up in a situation where nobody from the SRU team though we had a problem that needed to be resolved in some way before promoting the new kernel?\n[20:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; Pragmatically, we get stuff done quicker when the involved people can speak to each other high bandwidth without excessive bureaucracy\n[20:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: those kinds of technical details I think are something best worked through by the SRU team as we sort out responding to the email\n[20:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; seb128: I'm not aware that anybody flagged virtualbox as being broken by the new kernel.\n[20:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; At least, not to the SRU team.\n[20:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; Another complication is that the kernel SRU process operates fairly independently\n[20:31] &lt;seb128&gt; vorlon, ack\n[20:33] &lt;rbasak&gt; Eickmeyer: private matters regarding individuals&gt; I disagree. The complaints posted _are_ accusatory of the conduct of individuals.\n[20:34] &lt;vorlon&gt; independently of the rest of the SRU team, and also independently of the britney-triggered autopkgtests\n[20:34] &lt;rbasak&gt; There are various aspects of this matter that I am deliberately not going into here because it is inappropriate to discuss them publicly.\n[20:35] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; rbasak: Why is the SRU team discussing complaints of the conduct of individuals? That seems out of scope?\n[20:35]  * Eickmeyer is confused\n[20:35] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think it is in scope, but I cannot explain why exactly without going into private matters.\n[20:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'd be happy to explain to the TB in private, or to the CC in private.\n[20:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; But an escalation to the CC at this stage I think would be counterproductive. We need to stop being accusatory and try and resolve this constructively.\n[20:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok it's clear that the ball is in the SRU team's court for responding to the email, and I think we've exhausted any useful informal discussion here on the topic.  Moving on\n[20:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; #link https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002862.html launchpad-buildd-admin team ownership\n[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; On that topic, Ubuntu's infrastructure provision arrangements from Canonical pre-date my involvement, but there's plenty of stuff that we rely very heavily on Canonical IS for, and I don't see any reason why this case needs to be an exception. So following the existing pattern, it makes sense to me to delegate management of this stuff to Canonical, just like various other infrastructure where we\n[20:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; already do that.\n[20:38] &lt;rbasak&gt; So +1 from me\n[20:38] &lt;vorlon&gt; wgrant had approached me privately about this earlier and I said I had no reservations but that it should be public\n[20:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; of anyone likely to be accidentally exercising this privilege, it would be those members of the Archive Admin team that *happen* to also be on the TB (me, sil2100, seb128)\n[20:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; and there's no reason for that to be the case\n[20:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; and if we need stuff as AAs we can work that out directly with launchpad instead\n[20:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; any objections?\n[20:39] &lt;amurray&gt; +1 from me too (although I can't help but notice that since all current TB members are Canonical employees I wonder if there is a perceived conflict of interest in being asked about this)\n[20:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; well. given that this is true it would still only be Canonical employees able to *exercise* that acl\n[20:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; and afaik none of us do\n[20:40] &lt;amurray&gt; indeed\n=== shettysudhird is now known as sshetty\n[20:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok 3 +1, I'll just follow up to the mail to confirm that as a TB position, thanks\n[20:41] &lt;amurray&gt; thanks vorlon\n[20:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; #action vorlon to confirm TB agreement to launchpad-buildd-admins ownership change\n[20:41] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: vorlon to confirm TB agreement to launchpad-buildd-admins ownership change\n[20:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; #topic Check up on community bugs and techboard bugs\n[20:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-community/+bugs?field.assignee=techboard\n[20:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; zaroo boogs\n[20:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; #link https://bugs.launchpad.net/techboard\n[20:42] &lt;vorlon&gt; nothing new :/\n[20:42] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; Uh, what about Kubuntu requalification?\n[20:43] &lt;seb128&gt; sorry, I was catching up with other channels, I'm +1 also for the launchpad-buildd-admin\n[20:43] &lt;vorlon&gt; and there are carry-over actions for the two open bugs there\n[20:43] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128: thanks\n[20:43] &lt;seb128&gt; Eickmeyer, I was going to ask about that in the AOB\n[20:43] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; seb128: Ah, thx\n[20:43] &lt;seb128&gt; it just arrived an hour ago\n[20:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok sorry I was assuming that the flavor qual stuff as a whole was in hand and failed to consider that the new mail should have a driver assigned to it\n[20:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; #topic Select a chair for the next meeting (next from https://launchpad.net/~techboard/+members)\n[20:44] &lt;vorlon&gt; I believe next should be sil2100 with amurray as backup\n[20:44] &lt;amurray&gt; ack\n[20:45] &lt;vorlon&gt; #agreed next chair: sil2100, backup: amurray\n[20:45] &lt;meetingology&gt; AGREED: next chair: sil2100, backup: amurray\n[20:45] &lt;vorlon&gt; #topic AOB\n[20:45] &lt;vorlon&gt; seb128:\n[20:45] &lt;seb128&gt; we missed https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/technical-board/2024-January/002864.html in the list review\n[20:45] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (not bringing it up right now, but I have a question related to Lubuntu LTS requalification at some point before AOB ends)\n[20:45] &lt;seb128&gt; we should have somone doing the review and call for a vote if it's ready\n[20:46] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; w.r.t. the Kubuntu LTS requalification, I see that Scarlett didn't list any official contacts. This was a hang-up for Lubuntu, and I know who the contacts are. Would it be helpful for me to reply to that email with that info so that someone from the Kubuntu Council can +1 it?\n[20:47] &lt;vorlon&gt; arraybolt3: might speed things up, sure\n[20:47] &lt;vorlon&gt; to be clear, flavors don't need to feel any urgency about this process (there was one email apologizing for being late)\n[20:47] &lt;vorlon&gt; we have until April to make final decisions\n[20:47] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; To be fair, that's only 2 months with lots of stuff to do in between.\n[20:48] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; still, good to know that we aren't already too late (I was a bit worried with how long Lubuntu was taking, so this is good new info for me to have).\n[20:48] &lt;ricktimmis&gt; +1\n[20:48] &lt;vorlon&gt; anyone on the TB want to volunteer to drive Kubuntu qual?\n[20:49] &lt;amurray&gt; I can take it\n[20:49] &lt;vorlon&gt; #action amurray to follow up with Kubuntu on 24.04 LTS request\n[20:49] &lt;meetingology&gt;

Happy to be point of contact for Kubuntu\n[20:50] &lt;vorlon&gt; ricktimmis: apologies, but I have no idea who you are that you are volunteering?\n[20:50] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; He is a Kubuntu Council member\n[20:51] &lt;arraybolt3&gt;

well anyway, Kubuntu folks should among them decide who it's going to be and post to the list please\n[20:51] &lt;vorlon&gt; ricktimmis: nice to meet you (after you've been on the Kubuntu Council for 6 years ;)\n[20:51] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; ricktimmis: it sounds like you're better equipped to post that info, so I'll leave that alone so I don't mess anything up :P\n[20:52] &lt;amurray&gt; yes please, that way I know who to reply to since Scarlett didn't CC anyone else\n[20:52] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; ricktimmis: You know me, so if you need help, you know who to find as well.\n[20:52] &lt;vorlon&gt; any other AOB?\n[20:52] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; o/\n[20:53] &lt;rbasak&gt; o/\n[20:53] &lt;arraybolt3&gt;

I was basing myself only on the "allowed" log you pasted. we are currently working on improving attach_disconnected because it's very permissive, but a lot of applications need it. depending on the version you're running, you can specify the path using flags=(attach_disconnected.path=/foo)\n[11:42] &lt;Apparmortastic&gt;

still need to sort out python-apt and apt it's a bit messy right now\n[16:31] &lt;enr0n&gt; bdmurray: yes\n[16:31] &lt;vorlon&gt; netplan.io vs wpa: ogayot was working on this and raised an MP against britney to badtest it which I rejected\n[16:31] &lt;vorlon&gt;

btw, it's impacting ncurses too I think (it's purely in ruby, and everything ruby3.1 will fail)\n[16:36] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok, apt vs systemd. enr0n you uploaded systemd, do you want to follow up on this or do you want someone else to take it?\n[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; looks like there are a good number of autopkgtests needing sorted for systemd, not just apt\n[16:37] &lt;enr0n&gt; vorlon: I am working on another systemd upload (real failures in systemd's tests), so yes consider that with me\n[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; ok\n[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; enr0n: I assume systemd-hwe is similar, since it's your upload and it's your autopkgtests that are failing\n[16:38] &lt;enr0n&gt; vorlon: yes, systemd-hwe needs the new systemd\n[16:38] &lt;vorlon&gt; but doesn't declare a versioned dependency on it?\n[16:39] &lt;juliank&gt; heh I said the same thing but I don't remember wehre\n[16:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; (if it needs the new systemd at runtime and you declare a versioned dependency for this the autopkgtests would just dtrt I think; and also it would dtrt on the user's system...)\n[16:39] &lt;vorlon&gt; gnutls28, I'll take; just some autopkgtests to chase on ppc64el it looks like\n[16:39] &lt;schopin&gt; Wouldn't the autopkgtests just end up with all-proposed?\n[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; um and then the perl transition\n[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; so I'm not going to try to dig through here to find things to assign out\n[16:40] &lt;juliank&gt; heh\n[16:40] &lt;vorlon&gt; juliank: back to you :)\n[16:41] &lt;enr0n&gt; it's just for autopkgtest; the path to a test binary changed\n[16:41] &lt;juliank&gt; I still am sorting out apt and python-apt, enr0n are you planning any ubuntu-release-upgrader upload?\n[16:41] &lt;vorlon&gt; enr0n: ok\n[16:41] &lt;enr0n&gt; juliank: no nothing planned at the moment\n[16:41] &lt;juliank&gt; Otherwise I can go and upload a version that adapts to the new deb822 ordering changes in python-apt myself\n[16:41] &lt;juliank&gt;

I noted lack of cooperation generally speaking on that email, and I've seen a drastic change for the better. I still have some (genuine) questions around the SRU Team given recent events, but I'm planning a postmorteum on virtualbox anyway.\n[20:29] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Also, I appointed Aaron and Dan as assistant release managers, there's no direct action required from the TB, but a "hey we see this" would be great. :)\n[20:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; Well I asked and was told that no response was expected?\n[20:30] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Yes :) I'm glad you saw it, just making a general point to it.\n[20:30] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; Anyway, those are the points I have, happy to answer any questions.\n[20:30] &lt;seb128&gt; I'm not aware the SRU team situation you are referencing to but it doesn't seem to be a TB topic at this point?\n[20:31] &lt;seb128&gt; aware of*\n[20:31] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm not sure either.\n[20:32] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; My general point is, asking for requalification is a two-way agreement.

will this change to v2 to not be stuck?\n[15:49] &lt;eslerm&gt; I'm not sure what stuck means, debian hasn't updated to v2 yet\n[15:49] &lt;sarnold&gt; the pydantic in debian seems unhappy https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1058324 and the v2 uses rust https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1052619 -- there may not be an easy path forward\n[15:49] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Debian bug 1058324 in src:pydantic "pydantic: FTBFS: failed tests" [Serious, Open]\n[15:49] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

there are really many 2.x updates but only minimal fix updates on 1.x\n[15:50] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: and they have no namespacing calling it pydantic2 to be co-installable or any such?\n[15:51] &lt;eslerm&gt; I'm not aware of that\n[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hrm\n[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, incomplete is right for james and the team to answer how they want to deal with that\n[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; it can be 1.x now, but we'd need a commitment to make it 2.x to maintain it in the long run - is that the correct state eslerm?\n[15:51] &lt;eslerm&gt; that feels appropriate to me\n[15:51] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; eslerm: would you require 2.x in noble or any time later?\n[15:52] &lt;eslerm&gt; likely, Seth?\n[15:52] &lt;eslerm&gt; security support in LTS would be much better with 2.x\n[15:52] &lt;jamespage&gt; I don't think that's under debate and I did comment on this - it just quite a wide set of packages to test and update to bump to 2 right now\n[15:52] &lt;sarnold&gt; I'm not sure "require" is quite the right word; the timing is pretty poor :(\n[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; indeed\n[15:52] &lt;eslerm&gt; +1\n[15:52] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; reading more of the backlog\n[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; we even discussed that\n[15:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; a change of this magnitude would be nice to do *before* an LTS release; I could easily imagine the upstream folks moving on to a hypothetical 2.1 and 2.2 etc in quick order, as they keep making progress...\n[15:53] &lt;jamespage&gt; we did\n[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; and I should remember as I posted in november\n[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; "- not going to 2.x for now, thanks for explaining"\n[15:53] &lt;sarnold&gt; hah, nice\n[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; ok, so this can go back to in-progress\n[15:53] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; was worth to make sure\n[15:53] &lt;eslerm&gt; upstreams comment was: "Just to confirm, I assume it will be pydantic V2 that's added to Ubuntu main?!

Thank you!\n[16:26] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; o/ Thanks :)\n[16:27] &lt;rbasak&gt; I will have questions shortly\n[16:27] &lt;rbasak&gt; Anyone else, feel free\n[16:29] &lt;rbasak&gt; arraybolt3: let's say that you're about to upload a package merge from Debian and it's a couple of days before feature freeze. How would you check, technically, that you're not about to inadvertently trigger a large transition?\n[16:29] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Probably my first step is to look at the reverse depends with apt-cache rdepends.\n[16:29] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; after that, if there were some reverse depends, I check those reverse depends and so on.\n[16:29] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Usually shared libraries are at higher risk of causing these sorts of things than applications.\n[16:30] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (shared libraries including things like Python libraries, not necessarily libwhatever1 packages)\n[16:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; What would you be looking at in the rdepends list?\n[16:30] &lt;rbasak&gt; s/at/for/\n[16:30] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; mainly to see how big the network of rdepends is. One or two might not be a huge deal depending on what those one or two are...\n[16:31] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; ...but if there's a large network of them then I know to exercise caution and potentially not attempt the process at all.\n[16:31] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; I could also check the update excuses page to see if packages that were rdepends were already part of transitions.\n[16:31] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Since entangling those could block other transitions and cause Big Problems.\n[16:31] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (the page I'm referring to is https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html)\n[16:32] &lt;rbasak&gt; Could you explain to me what you understand a transition to be exactly, please?\n[16:32]  * arraybolt3 opens the Proposed Migration page...\n[16:33] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; A transition is when a package migrates from -proposed to -release after Britney and autopkgtest verifies that this won't break anything.\n[16:34] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (won't break anything = passes all five points at the top of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ProposedMigration)\n[16:34] &lt;rbasak&gt; I think you're describing proposed migration as opposed to a transition\n[16:35] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; for some reason I didn't realize there was a difference, we call it a "python3 transition" when the python3-default package is uploaded.\n[16:36] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; since that triggers a whole web of autopkgtests and if any of those fail, then the package is blocked and the failures need to be fixed before the transition can migrate\n[16:36] &lt;rbasak&gt; It's true that a transition should hold up proposed migration until it is complete, so the two concepts are very closely linked.\n[16:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; And you're right that autopkgtest failures hold up proposed migrations\n[16:37] &lt;rbasak&gt; ie. there are multiple things that hold up proposed migration, and one of those is that there's a transition in progress\n[16:38] &lt;rbasak&gt; It's possible that you understand what I'm looking for and we're just getting stuck in terminology\n[16:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let's say that src:foo 1.0 is in the archive, and it produces binary packages libfoo1 which various packages depend on, and libfoo-dev which those packages build depend on.\n[16:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; What are the implications of uploading src:foo 2.0, which moves on to libfoo2?\n[16:39] &lt;rbasak&gt; In relation to proposed migration?\n[16:40] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; API breaking changes which would very likely cause autopkgtest failures due to the need for the entangled packages to be updated to use the new API.\n[16:40] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; in which case you end up with multiple interrelated packages migrating together once everything passes the proposed migration tests.\n[16:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let's pretend that there are no autopkgtests in any of the relevant packages, so nothing is held up by autopkgtest failures\n[16:41] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (er, sorry, I mean reverse dependencies when I say entangled packages)\n[16:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; Why would proposed migration be held up?\n[16:41] &lt;rbasak&gt; Why would proposed migration _still_ be held up?\n[16:41] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Lots of possible reasons: it could no longer build and publish on an architecture it used to...\n[16:42] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; ...there could be dependency issues that would result in unsatisfied dependencies if the package(s) migrate...\n[16:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; What dependency issues exactly?\n[16:42] &lt;rbasak&gt; My example is the common case of a completely routine transition, so my expectation is that you should be able to follow and give me the specific dependency issue that would hold things up\n[16:43] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Anything that would cause apt to be unable to install the package were it in the archive, i.e. a dependency is missing or the proper version isn't available because (for instance) one of the reverse depends isn't updated to use the new version of the library.\n[16:43] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; so for a concrete example:\n[16:43] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; src:libfoo 1.0 exists, and package bar 1.0 depends on it.\n[16:43] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; libfoo2 is uploaded.\n[16:44] &lt;rbasak&gt; package bar 1.0 depends on what exactly?\n[16:44] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; bar 1.0 depends on libfoo1.\n[16:44] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; hold on, I'm getting slightly mixed up\n[16:45] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; so src:libfoo 1.0 is uploaded, bar 1.0 is uploaded which has a Depends: libfoo1 (= 1.0), then src:libfoo 2.0 is uploaded.\n[16:46] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; now bar 1.0 can no longer satisfy its dependency, so bar 2.0 has to be uploaded also before they can migrate together.\n[16:47] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK I think you have enough of an understanding there. Though note that a straight rebuild of bar 1.0 might be sufficient, since it's the ABI that changed, and it's possible that the API remains the same or that bar uses a small enough subset that it works without changes against foo 2.\n[16:47] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; True.\n[16:47] &lt;rbasak&gt; So, going back a few steps, what exactly would you be looking for to see if you're going to inadvertently trigger this kind of situation?\n[16:48] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; ah, I get it better now. Soname bumps mainly, but also versioned Depends since it's not just shared objects that can cause transitions.\n[16:48] &lt;rbasak&gt; At least in the common case. I realise an exhaustive search is difficult, but what are the most common indicators?\n[16:48] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; so if I build libfoo and end up with libfoo2 when I had libfoo1, that's a red flag.\n[16:48] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. Thanks!\n[16:49] &lt;rbasak&gt; My next question was going to be about proposed migration but I think you've covered that enough already :)\n[16:49] &lt;rbasak&gt; Next question: when is feature freeze for Noble, where would I look up that information, and who can authorise an exception and where is that process documented?\n[16:50] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; The page where the freezes are documented for Noble is at https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-schedule/35649. According to that calendar, Feature Freeze is February 29, 2024.\n[16:51] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; The freeze exception process is documented at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FreezeExceptionProcess.\n[16:51] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; the Release Team are the ones who can ACK an FFe.\n[16:52] &lt;rbasak&gt; Let's say that you'd like to upload new upstream release of foo 1.2.2, and 1.2.1 is currently in the archive, and it's March 1st. Is that acceptable? Or if that's not enough information, what extra information do you need to make a decision?\n[16:53] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Not enough information - what versioning scheme does foo 1.2.2 use? Is is a purely bugfix release? Or could it incorporate new features or breaking changes?\n[16:54] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; Assuming it uses semver, an upload of 1.2.2 is *probably* OK since 1.2.1 -&gt; 1.2.2 is a patch release.\n[16:55] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (I say probably since upstream might not strictly adhere to the rule of only making backwards-compatible bug fixes in a patch release, if they do make breaking API changes that's still a no-no)\n[16:55] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; (or if they introduce new API at all)\n[16:56] &lt;arraybolt3&gt; if for some reason the patch release is really important and isn't suitable for introduction after Feature Freeze, then I would either backport the parts of the release that are Feature Freeze compatible that I need, or request an FFe if necessary. That would have to be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n[16:57] &lt;rbasak&gt; OK. Thanks!\n[16:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; I'm just looking at your "regular" SRU history\n[16:58] &lt;rbasak&gt; I only see bug 1989203.

But I guess that's actually a good thing, so we can move away from /lib\n[16:08] &lt;enr0n&gt; slyon: yes I believe so\n[16:09] &lt;vorlon&gt; Ubuntu has been "usr merged" for several cycles; as long as your files don't go missing on upgrade due to the /lib -&gt; /usr/lib move, it's fine to use the new path\n[16:09] &lt;vorlon&gt; there's discussion on debian-devel about some of the pitfalls, mostly to do with Replaces: between packages at the same time as paths change\n[16:10] &lt;slyon&gt; ACK. I think for Netplan it's not too special. We've been shipping the generator in /lib/ for legacy reasons, but I think the move should be pretty simple\n[16:12] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Skia: What happened upstream with klibc?\n[16:13] &lt;Skia&gt; nothing yet, the MR I uploaded to noble is still not merged: https://salsa.debian.org/kernel-team/klibc/-/merge_requests/12\n[16:13] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Merge 12 in kernel-team/klibc "d/i/h/klibc-utils: Fix compatibility issue with busybox and improve verbose debug output." [Opened]\n[16:15] &lt;bdmurray&gt; Oh, debian modified coreutils ... got it\n[16:15] &lt;Skia&gt; what happened instead is that Debian reverted upstream's behavior change in coreutils, so that cp and mv don't start breaking all the scripts of the world, and added a deprecation warning that upstream forgot\n[16:16] &lt;Skia&gt; but I also red that they still need to fix broken cp/mv usage in packages, and that should include klibc\n[16:16] &lt;adrien&gt; the change in coreutils is not new anymore by now though\n[16:17] &lt;Skia&gt; according to the discussions upstream, it's not new, but it's not widely shipped by distributions either, so in a sense, it's quite new\n[16:17] &lt;bdrung&gt; enough time to read the reports. moving on.\n[16:18] &lt;bdrung&gt; #topic Release incoming bugs\n[16:18] &lt;bdrung&gt; #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-nn-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs\n[16:18] &lt;bdrung&gt; bug #1969394\n[16:18] &lt;adrien&gt; yeah, it's new for us because 9.2 and 9.3 had not been shipped in debian and ubuntu\n[16:18] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 1969394 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "'Settings &amp; Livepatch' button opens 'settings' tab, not livepatch" [Low, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1969394\n[16:18] &lt;Skia&gt; correct\n[16:19] &lt;bdrung&gt; that update-manager bug is about UI changes and therefore belongs to the desktop team\n[16:20] &lt;bdrung&gt; bug #2017401\n[16:20] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2017401 in unattended-upgrades (Ubuntu Jammy) "Unexpected / unwanted unattended-upgrades behaviour after kernel upgrade when Livepatch enabled" [Undecided, Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2017401\n[16:24] &lt;vorlon&gt; that one should be taken for noble, but there's no action for Foundations at the moment because there's a dependency on changes to livepatch to expose the necessary information about whether a reboot is required\n[16:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; I think we should go ahead and target this\n[16:27] &lt;bdrung&gt; okay, i'll tag it.\n[16:28] &lt;bdrung&gt; #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-mm-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs\n[16:29] &lt;bdrung&gt; bug #2041518 is for the desktop team\n[16:29] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2041518 in gtk+3.0 (Ubuntu) "/usr/share/apport/apport-gtk:5:_g_log_abort:g_log_writer_default:g_log_structured_array:g_log_structured_array:g_log_structured_standard" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2041518\n[16:29] &lt;bdrung&gt; bug #2041831\n[16:29] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Bug 2041831 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "/usr/bin/update-manager:11:g_type_check_instance_is_fundamentally_a:g_object_ref:gdk_event_copy:pygi_boxed_copy_in_place:arg_boxed_to_py_cleanup" [Undecided, New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/2041831\n[16:32] &lt;vorlon&gt; I'll ask the Desktop Team to investigate\n[16:32] &lt;bdrung&gt; #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ll-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs\n[16:32] &lt;bdrung&gt; nothing for us\n[16:32] &lt;bdrung&gt; #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-jj-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs\n[16:33] &lt;bdrung&gt; nothing for us\n[16:33] &lt;bdrung&gt; #link http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/rls-mgr/rls-ff-incoming-bug-tasks.html#foundations-bugs\n[16:34] &lt;bdrung&gt; nothing marked for us, but 12 unknown\n[16:34] &lt;bdrung&gt; #topic Team proposed-migration report\n[16:34] &lt;bdrung&gt; #link https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/proposed-migration/update_excuses_by_team.html#foundations-bugs\n[16:35] &lt;bdrung&gt; handing over to vorlon\n[16:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; per ginggs we can ignore the python3-defaults stuff, he and doko are working through that\n[16:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; apt aiui is with juliank\n[16:35] &lt;vorlon&gt; libcgi-pm-perl blocked for a little bit\n[16:36] &lt;bdrung&gt; i like to take pycryptodome which would be a follow up on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pycryptodome/+bug/2039968\n[16:36] -ubottu:#ubuntu-meeting- Launchpad bug 2039968 in pycryptodome (Debian) "pycryptodome: Baseline violation on i386 and test FTBFS on !x86" [Unknown, Confirmed]\n[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; sounds like libcgi-pm-perl was with cpete, and needs some autopkgtests triggered cleverly\n[16:37] &lt;vorlon&gt; cpete: can you follow up with this?

doko: ^^ in case you want to raise this in the team this week already\n[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; jbicha: seb128: didrocks: FYI on the duplicity case\n[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; let us know by next week once you had a chance to look\n[15:35] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

maas -&gt; ipmitools is gone after Dimitri and Adam and I sorted that out\n[15:36] &lt;sarnold&gt; there's much less perl around ..\n[15:36] &lt;sarnold&gt; OMG OMG OMG\n[15:36] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; hehe\n[15:36] &lt;eslerm&gt; what is the new group they are in?\n[15:37] &lt;sarnold&gt; our christmas wishes did come true!\n[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; they are in the maas-community seed which has other things they use but are only on community level of support\n[15:37] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; which is true for ipmitools as well, and in future also isc-dhcp-server which got demoted (we moved that as well)\n[15:37] &lt;eslerm&gt; that is a good place for them :)\n[15:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt; enough happiness, let us look at a potentially huge queue without many people to process it\n[15:38] &lt;cpaelzer&gt;

We simply do *not* have a place to put it.\n[20:16] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; It seems weird to be waiting just because of an issue with publication in a particular place. I suggest just using Discourse in the meantime and so whether it is blocking or not shouldn't even need to be a question.\n[20:16] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; We're working with Aaron Prisk to get IS to work on this, but they don't have it as a priority item.\n[20:17] &lt;sil2100&gt; So maybe like this: if by around release time the hosting situation is still not solved, would it be possible for you to publish a discourse post with all the details instead?\n[20:17] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; sil2100: It will be in the release notes for sure if the hosting situation isn't resolved. Our release notes have been published to Discourse in the meantime.\n[20:17] &lt;vorlon&gt; NB hosting of per-flavor websites is not listed on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecognizedFlavors as part of what Canonical commits to\n[20:18] &lt;sil2100&gt; Eickmeyer: that sounds like a good plan B to me\n[20:18] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray WDYT?\n[20:18] &lt;amurray&gt; works for me\n[20:18] &lt;sil2100&gt; Let's vote\n[20:18] &lt;Eickmeyer&gt; vorlon: Edubuntu used to be hosted by Canonical, and Ubuntu Studio currently is, along with Kubuntu, so there's precident.\n[20:19] &lt;sil2100&gt; #vote Signing off on Edubuntu 24.04 LTS request\n[20:19] &lt;meetingology&gt; Please vote on: Signing off on Edubuntu 24.04 LTS request\n[20:19] &lt;meetingology&gt; Public votes can be registered by saying +1, -1 or +0 in channel (for private voting, private message me with 'vote +1|-1|+0 #channelname')\n[20:19] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; No precedent for an SLA though.

Thank you!\n[20:23] &lt;amurray&gt; yep\n[20:23] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action amurray to send confirmation of successful LTS status for Edubuntu 24.04\n[20:23] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: amurray to send confirmation of successful LTS status for Edubuntu 24.04\n[20:23] &lt;sil2100&gt; Carrying over seb's item\n[20:23] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu budgie on 24.04 request\n[20:23] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: seb128 to follow-up with ubuntu budgie on 24.04 request\n[20:23] &lt;sil2100&gt; ACTION: amurray to follow-up with ubuntu kylin on 24.04 request\n[20:24] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray: ^ any luck with Kylin? I might have missed any ML threads regarding this\n[20:24] &lt;amurray&gt; I proposed voting via email yesterday\n[20:24] &lt;tsimonq2&gt; rbasak-mobile: There is existing precedence for flavors to ask Canonical to host infrastructure, however, to my knowledge it's been a courtesy rather than a requirement. For example, our domain is hosted by Canonical, and if that goes down, that would certainly reflect poorly on our qualification efforts.\n[20:25] &lt;vorlon&gt; since the UbuntuKylin vote has already been called on the mailing list I propose we continue it there rather than voting in the meeting\n[20:25] &lt;sil2100&gt; amurray: do you want to vote here instead?\n[20:25] &lt;amurray&gt; I think email is fine\n[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; ACK o/\n[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; I'll carry it over then\n[20:26] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; I agree but again this shouldn't be relevant or seen as blocking. We can be pragmatic and just publish somewhere else eg. Discourse. Not need for this to formally block anything.\n[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; #action amurray to follow-up with ubuntu kylin on 24.04 request\n[20:26] &lt;meetingology&gt; ACTION: amurray to follow-up with ubuntu kylin on 24.04 request\n[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; Okay, let's move on\n[20:26] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic Scan the mailing list archive for anything we missed\n[20:26] &lt;vorlon&gt; note that there is also CFV on the mailing list for Ubuntu Unity\n[20:27] &lt;vorlon&gt; which wasn't assigned to me in the TB meeting when they were being assigned because I wasn't able to attend, instead I just picked up the ones that hadn't been assigned\n=== JanC_ is now known as JanC\n[20:27] &lt;sil2100&gt; I'll try to follow up on those with votes then\n[20:27] &lt;sil2100&gt; I think there are no actionable items on the ML that do not have actions already, from what I know?\n[20:28] &lt;sil2100&gt; Since we have the participation e-mails, the process thread, and all those have action items assigned\n[20:28] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; I think it's worth following up on a multitude of issues raised by the mutter regression but I'll follow up on the list first, hopefully this week.\n[20:28] &lt;sil2100&gt; rbasak-mobile: thanks\n[20:28] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic Check up on community bugs and techboard bugs'\n[20:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; Nothing new there\n[20:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic Select a chair for the next meeting\n[20:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; That would be amurray, with rbasak-mobile as backup\n[20:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; If that'\n[20:29] &lt;vorlon&gt; I'm very confused by that\n[20:29] &lt;sil2100&gt; If that's fine\n[20:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; the wiki page said it was supposed to be seb128 with me as backup\n[20:30] &lt;sil2100&gt; Well, amurray is next after me, right?\n[20:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; are we just jumping the pointer?\n[20:30] &lt;sil2100&gt; I have volunteered today as I have not chaired for quite a long time\n[20:30] &lt;vorlon&gt; I don't mind, it's just not historical practice :)\n[20:31] &lt;sil2100&gt; #topic AOB\n[20:31] &lt;amurray&gt; fwiw I think I am on leave during the next scheduled TB meeting so not sure if I will be able to make it at this time\n[20:31] &lt;sil2100&gt; Ah, so maybe back to the scheduled chairs then? seb and vorlon as backup?\n[20:32] &lt;sil2100&gt; If there are no objections, I'd propose that then\n[20:32] &lt;sil2100&gt; Any other business?\n[20:33] &lt;vorlon&gt; nothing else from me\n[20:33] &lt;amurray&gt; nor from me\n[20:34] &lt;rbasak-mobile&gt; Please don't wait on everyone to say no :-)\n[20:35] &lt;sil2100&gt; ;)\n[20:35] &lt;sil2100&gt; #endmeeting\n[20:35] &lt;meetingology&gt; Meeting ended at 20:35:29 UTC.
